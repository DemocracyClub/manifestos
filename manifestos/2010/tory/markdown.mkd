<h1 id="invitation_to_join_the_government_of_britain">Invitation to Join the Government of Britain</h1>

<p>A country is at its best when the bonds between people are strong and when the sense of 
national purpose is clear. today the challenges facing britain are immense. our economy is 
overwhelmed by debt, our social fabric is frayed and our political system has betrayed the people. 
but these problems can be overcome if we pull together and work together. if we remember that 
we are all in this together. </p>

<p>Some politicians say: ‘give us your vote and we will sort out all your problems’. We say:
real change comes not from government alone. real change comes when the people are 
inspired and mobilised, when millions of us are fired up to play a part in the nation’s future. 
Yes this is ambitious. Yes it is optimistic. but in the end all the acts of Parliament, all
the new measures, all the new policy initiatives, are just politicians’ words without you and 
your involvement. </p>

<p>How will we deal with the debt crisis unless we understand that we are all in this together? 
how will we raise responsible children unless every adult plays their part? how will we 
revitalise communities unless people stop asking ‘who will fix this?’ and start asking ‘what can 
I do?’ britain will change for the better when we all elect to take part, to take responsibility – if 
we all come together. Collective strength will overpower our problems. </p>

<p>Only together can we can get rid of this government and, eventually, its debt. only together
can we get the economy moving. only together can we protect the nhS. improve our schools. 
mend our broken society. together we can even make politics and politicians work better. and
if we can do that, we can do anything. Yes, together we can do anything. </p>

<p>So my invitation today is this: join us, to form a new kind of government for britain.</p>

<h1 id="foreword">FOREWORD</h1>

<p>Britain needs change: few can doubt that. Our national finances are mired in massive debt. 
millions are living the misery of unemployment. Communities are shattered by crime and abuse. 
People in the public services are trapped in a web of rules and regulations. People have lost faith 
that politics can fix our problems, or that politicians can lead us into a better future. There is a 
feeling of helplessness. once again, there is a mood afoot that the decline of britain is inevitable. </p>

<p>but there is no law that says we must accept decline. We have the energy, the ideas and the 
ambition to get britain back on track. and that includes everyone in britain, wherever they live 
and whatever their circumstances. if we join together, if we act decisively, and move forward with 
optimism, we can start to fix the economic, social and political problems that threaten the nation. 
We can bring about the change britain needs. </p>

<p>What is that change? Some promise solutions from on high – but real change comes from 
collective endeavour. So we offer a new approach: a change not just from one set of politicians to 
another; from one set of policies to another. it is a change from one political philosophy to another. 
from the idea that the role of the state is to direct society and micro-manage public services, to the 
idea that the role of the state is to strengthen society and make public services serve the people who 
use them. in a simple phrase, the change we offer is from big government to big Society. </p>

<p>This manifesto is the most important stage so far on a journey that began four and a half years 
ago, when the Conservative Party itself voted for change by electing David Cameron as its leader. 
Since then, the Party has remoulded itself for the modern era, applying its deepest values and 
beliefs to the urgent problems of the hour. even as it has done so, the problems confronting britain 
have escalated, and escalated fast. So our ideas are ambitious and radical as well as modern. they 
match the scale of britain’s problems, and are in tune with a world that is changing before our eyes. 
but our core values have not altered and our core beliefs remain consistent. </p>

<p>We believe in responsibility: government responsibility with public finances, personal 
responsibility for our actions, and social responsibility towards each other. We believe in enterprise 
and aspiration. We believe there is such a thing as society, it’s just not the same thing as the state. 
our fundamental tenet is that power should be devolved from politicians to people, from the central 
to the local. Personal ambition should be set as high as is humanly possible, with no barriers put in 
its way by the state. Perhaps most importantly, we believe that we are all in this together. </p>

<p>Everything you will find in this manifesto is built on these beliefs. They are the building blocks 
of the change we want to see in every home, every street, every community, every business.</p>

<p>Our belief in responsibility with public finances is the starting point of our plan for economic 
recovery and growth. We want your consent for a programme of public spending control that will 
deal with Labour’s debt crisis and stop the Labour jobs tax that would kill our economic recovery. 
the programme set out in this manifesto is fully costed and fully funded. Some of our proposals – 
such as on school discipline – cost nothing, but require energy and leadership. others – like
stopping Labour’s jobs tax – will require money, and we will make savings in other areas to pay
for them. the debt crisis is the terrible legacy that gordon brown is bequeathing to our country. 
But fiscal responsibility needs a social conscience or it is not responsible at all: so we will not allow 
the poorest people in britain to pay an unfair price for the mistakes of some of the richest. </p>

<p>Nor will we allow irresponsibility in the private sector to continue unchecked. We will bring 
law and order to our financial markets as a necessary step to restoring confidence. But the real 
prize for britain is to create a new economic model, one founded on investment and savings not 
borrowing and debt. This economic vision reflects our belief in enterprise and aspiration. It is a 
vision of a truly modern economy: one that is greener and more local. an economy where britain 
leads in science, technology and innovation. but it is founded on a determination that wealth 
and opportunity must be more fairly distributed. We want to see an economy where not just our 
standard of living, but everyone’s quality of life, rises steadily and sustainably. </p>

<p>But a nation is only really successful if it is built on a strong society. We will never deal with 
our debts and build a new economy unless we solve the social problems that cost so much and hold 
so many people back. Labour’s big government approach is making our social problems worse, not 
better – inequality and poverty on the rise; social mobility stalled; family breakdown a fact
of life for too many children. So we need fundamental change: from big government that presumes 
to know best, to the big Society that trusts in the people for ideas and innovation. </p>

<p>We will move from state action to social action, encouraging social responsibility in all its 
forms and across all the country – whether curbing incivility on our streets or supporting social 
enterprises with the power to transform neighbourhoods. mending britain’s broken society will
be a central aim of the next Conservative government. 
that is why in this manifesto we set ourselves an ambitious goal: to make britain the most 
family-friendly country in europe. that is why we back the nhS. that is why we will reform 
schools to raise standards and restore discipline. It is why we will get people off benefits and into 
work; reform policing, sentencing and prisons. and why we are committed to a greener future.</p>

<p>But we will not succeed in building the big Society, or in building a new economic model, 
unless we stop government trying to direct everything from the centre. We will get nowhere with 
yet more top-down state control. So, after thirteen years of Labour, we need radical political 
reform. We need to change the whole way this country is run. as Conservatives, we trust people. 
We believe that if people are given more responsibility, they will behave more responsibly. We 
believe that if you decentralise power, you get better results and better value for money. So the 
plans set out in this manifesto represent an unprecedented redistribution of power and control 
from the central to the local, from politicians and the bureaucracy to individuals, families and 
neighbourhoods. </p>

<p>We will give people much more say over the things that affect their daily lives. We will make 
government, politics and public services much more open and transparent. and we will give the 
people who work in our public services much greater responsibility. but in return, they will have
to answer to the people. all these measures will help restore trust in our broken political system. </p>

<p>We know that this is an ambitious vision. a profoundly optimistic vision. it is also an 
authentically Conservative vision: sound money, backing enterprise, trusting people. the journey 
we embarked on four and a half years ago was all about applying this Conservative approach 
to the progressive challenges of our age: making opportunity more equal; fighting poverty and 
inequality; improving the environment and general well-being. So our creed today is progressive 
Conservatism; and this is an unashamedly progressive Conservative manifesto. </p>

<p>Now we ask you to join us for the next and most important stage of the journey: changing 
britain so we can offer a better life to all our citizens and play a proud and leading role in the world. </p>

<p>Each of the three programmes of reform outlined in this manifesto – our plans to build a new 
economic model; to build the big Society; to build a political system where people have more 
power and control over their lives – is a massive undertaking in its own right. Yet we are proposing 
to carry out these changes all at once, because that is the only way to put britain on the right path 
for a successful future. </p>

<p>Britain faces huge problems that demand radical change; and it cannot come soon enough. 
We are impatient to get on with this work. We are determined to make a difference. We have the 
policies to make that difference. and most importantly, we have faith in the people of britain, 
because we know that if we all pull together, stick together, then this country can change its future.</p>

<h4 id="glasgow">Glasgow</h4>

<p>Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and home to 13,000 
businesses, including some of Britain’s most successful fi rms. For 
example, eight of the ten largest insurance companies in the UK have 
an offi ce in Glasgow, and the city is also home to leading technology, 
energy and creative businesses. glasgow is the hub of an important 
entrepreneurial sector, which includes innovative start-ups in fi elds 
such as mobile telephony and computer games. glasgow’s commercial 
strength also extends to manufacturing, and the city continues to be a 
global leader in hi-tech ship building.</p>

<h1 id="change_the_economy">Change the economy</h1>

<h3 id="get_the_economy_moving">Get the Economy Moving</h3>

<p>Gordon Brown’s debt, waste and taxes have wrecked the economy and threaten to kill the 
recovery. A Conservative government will take action now to cut the deficit, stop Labour’s jobs 
tax, help keep mortgage rates low and get the economy moving. We will create a new economic 
model built on investment and savings, not borrowing and debt. </p>

<p>Where is the growth going to come from? Who will provide jobs for the millions out of work? 
how will families be able to aspire to a better future? these are the questions being asked about 
britain, at home and abroad. </p>

<p>One thing is clear. We can’t go on with the old model of an economy built on debt. irresponsible 
public spending, an overblown banking sector, and unsustainable consumer borrowing on the back 
of a housing bubble were the features of an age of irresponsibility that left Britain badly exposed to 
the economic crisis. now, with the national debt already doubled and in danger of doubling again, it 
is this debt – together with the jobs tax that Labour will introduce to help pay for it – that threatens 
to kill the recovery. </p>

<p>Britain needs a new economic model. Saving and business investment must replace reckless 
borrowing as the foundation of growth. We need to boost enterprise and develop a low carbon, 
hi-tech economy. Our exports must grow. We need to get Britain working by creating jobs in the 
private sector, and we must get better value for money from the public sector. </p>

<p>With the next Conservative government, our tax system, education and national infrastructure 
will help British firms out-compete their global rivals, not hold them back. We will build a more 
balanced economy that does not depend so heavily on the success of financial services, and where 
all parts of the country share in the gains. the bedrock of this new economic model will be the 
stability and low interest rates that come from a credible plan to reduce our record budget deficit, 
protect Britain’s credit rating and give taxpayers value for their money. </p>

<p>Building this new economic model requires a national effort. We can reverse britain’s economic 
decline – but only if we accept that we are all in this together. no government, even a strong and 
united one, can create a better country alone. it needs individuals, families and businesses pulling 
alongside. We want to unite everyone in our country behind this bold vision of a new british 
economic model.</p>

<h3 id="benchmarks_for_britain">benchmarks for britain</h3>

<p>For the first time, the British people will have eight clear and transparent benchmarks against 
which they can judge the economic success or failure of the next government. We will be 
accountable and open. These are the eight Benchmarks for Britain. Achieving them over the next 
Parliament will mean we have put Britain back on its feet and are building a new British economic 
model, very different from the debt-driven economy of recent years. </p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure macroeconomic stability: We will safeguard britain’s credit rating with a credible plan
to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will seek to
help keep interest rates lower for longer. the independent bank of england will continue to
target 2 per cent Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, and will use its new role in prudential
supervision to preserve financial stability. </li>
<li>Create a more balanced economy: We will create the conditions for higher exports, business
investment and saving as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). </li>
<li>get britain working again: We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of
children in workless households as part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality. </li>
<li>Encourage enterprise: We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness
and business regulation. </li>
<li>Ensure the whole country shares in rising prosperity: We will increase the private sector’s share
of the economy in all regions of the country, especially outside London and the South east. </li>
<li>Reform public services to deliver better value for money: We will raise productivity growth
in the public sector in order to deliver better schools and a better nhS. </li>
<li>Create a safer banking system that serves the needs of the economy: We will reform the
regulation and structure of the banking system to ensure lower levels of leverage, less
dependence on unstable wholesale funding, and greater availability of credit for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). </li>
<li>Build a greener economy: We will reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions and increase our
share of global markets for low carbon technologies.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ensure_macroeconomic_stability">Ensure Macroeconomic Stability</h3>

<p>We will safeguard Britain’s credit rating with a credible plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural 
deficit over a Parliament. Our fiscal policy will help keep interest rates lower for longer. The 
independent Bank of England will continue to target 2 per cent CPI inflation, and will use its new 
role in prudential supervision to preserve financial stability. </p>

<p>After a decade of mismanagement, the UK 
entered the recession in poor shape, with the 
second biggest budget defi cit in the developed 
world. We have been honest about the scale of 
the problem, and the actions we will need to 
take to deal with it. this will not be easy, but 
we can overcome our problems if we all pull 
together. </p>

<p>The absence of a credible plan to deal with our 
record budget defi cit, the largest of any major 
economy, is creating uncertainty over britain’s 
credit rating and interest rates. this instability 
undermines confi dence and jeopardises 
investment. it could tip britain back into 
recession. this is gordon brown’s legacy – 
and why the greatest risk to our economic 
recovery is fi ve more years of Gordon Brown. </p>

<h3 id="urgent_action_to_reduce_debt">Urgent action to reduce debt</h3>

<p>Urgent action is needed if we are to avoid the 
higher borrowing costs that would inevitably 
follow from a credit rating downgrade. So 
we will cut wasteful government spending 
to bring the defi cit down and restore stability. </p>

<p>We will increase spending on health in real 
terms every year and honour our commitments 
on international aid, but our plan to get a grip 
on the defi cit will include cuts to wasteful 
spending in many other departmental budgets. 
that will enable the independent bank of 
england to keep interest rates as low as possible 
for as long as possible. </p>

<p>To ensure that no Labour government can 
ever attempt to bankrupt our public finances 
again, we will set up an independent Office 
for budget responsibility to restore trust in 
the government’s ability to manage the public 
finances. </p>

<p>We will provide an emergency budget within 
50 days of taking offi ce to set out a credible 
plan for eliminating the bulk of the structural 
current budget defi cit over a Parliament. The 
case for starting early to re-establish our 
economic credibility is overwhelming, and is 
backed by economists and business leaders.</p>

<p>We will start by cutting a net £6 billion of 
wasteful departmental spending in the financial 
year 2010/11. in addition, we will make the 
following savings: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freeze public sector pay for one year in </p></li>
<li><p>2011, excluding the one million lowest paid 
workers; 
hold a review to bring forward the date at </p></li>
<li><p>Which the state pension age starts to rise to 
66, although it will not be sooner than 2016 
for men and 2020 for women; 
stop paying tax credits to better-off families </p></li>
<li><p>With incomes over £50,000; 
cut government contributions to Child trust </p></li>
<li><p>Funds for all but the poorest third of families 
and families with disabled children; 
cap public sector pensions above £50,000; </p></li>
<li><p>Cut ministers’ pay by 5 per cent, followed by </p></li>
<li><p>A five year freeze; and, 
reduce the number of mPs by 10 per cent. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of a Parliament, we will cut 
Whitehall policy, funding and regulation 
costs by a third, saving £2 billion a year, and 
save a further £1 billion a year from quango 
bureaucracy. </p>

<h3 id="cut_government_waste_to_stop_labours_jobs_tax">Cut government waste to stop Labour’s jobs tax</h3>

<p>Labour are planning to increase national 
insurance in 2011. anyone earning over 
£20,000 will pay more tax, and employers 
will pay more tax on all jobs paid over £5,700. 
This jobs tax, which will hit small businesses 
especially hard, will kill off the recovery. 
Experts predict it will cost 57,000 jobs in small 
and medium-sized businesses alone. </p>

<p>At the same time, Labour will not take action to 
cut waste in government. They have identified 
£11 billion pounds of waste, but they do not 
plan to start dealing with it until april 2011. 
So Labour will continue wasting money while 
putting up taxes on working people. </p>

<p>We will act immediately to cut government 
waste so we can stop the most damaging part of 
the national insurance rise for employers and 
for anyone earning under £35,000. 
We will make the following changes in april 
2011, relative to Labour’s plans: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Raise the primary threshold for national </p></li>
<li><p>Insurance by £24 a week and raise the Upper 
earnings Limit by £29 a week; and, 
raise the secondary threshold at which </p></li>
<li><p>Employers start paying national insurance
by £21 a week.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seven out of ten working people – those 
earning between £7,100 and £45,400 – and 
almost every employer will save up to £150 
a year per person compared to under Labour. 
Lower earners will get the greatest benefit as 
a percentage of their earnings. nobody will be 
worse off as a result of these changes. </p>

<p>Our plans are backed by many of britain’s top 
business leaders, who between them employ 
more than half a million people, as well as by 
britain’s leading business organisations. </p>

<p>To pay for this we will take immediate action 
to cut a net £6 billion of wasteful departmental 
spending in the financial year 2010/11, with 
further savings in future years. This is in 
addition to the savings made by cutting tax 
credits and Child trust funds for better-
off families. </p>

<p>These actions will allow us to reduce the 
deficit more quickly than Labour year-on-year 
while avoiding the most damaging part of 
their jobs tax. It will also lower the proportion 
of the reduction of the structural deficit that 
is accounted for by tax increases, from about 
one third towards one fifth. This is in line 
with international best practice, as well as the 
treasury’s own internal analysis. </p>

<p>Former government advisers Sir Peter gershon 
and Dr martin read have advised us that 
savings of £12 billion across all departmental 
spending are possible in-year without affecting 
the quality of frontline services. these are 
over and above any savings already planned by 
Labour. We will achieve this through: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A freeze on major new information and </p></li>
<li><p>Communications Technologies (ICT) 
spending; 
immediate negotiations to achieve cost </p></li>
<li><p>reductions from major suppliers; 
tighter control of public sector recruitment; </p></li>
<li><p>reductions in discretionary spending, </p></li>
<li><p>including travel, expenses, advertising, 
consultancy and office supplies; and, 
reductions in public sector property costs. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will match Labour’s spending plans for 
2010/11 in health and overseas aid. given our 
commitment to carry out a Strategic Defence 
and Security review, it would also not be 
appropriate to make in-year reductions to the 
existing defence budget in 2010/11. Savings 
in these protected areas will be channelled 
back into frontline services. the net £6 billion 
of savings will be made from the remaining 
departmental budgets.</p>

<h3 id="create_a_more_balanced_economy">Create a more balanced economy</h3>

<p>We will create the conditions for higher exports, business investment and saving as a share of gdP. </p>

<p>For the last decade, growth has been too 
dependent on government spending and debt- 
fuelled consumption. more than half of the new 
jobs created were driven by public spending. 
Household savings collapsed, and the UK has 
the lowest investment as a share of gDP of 
any G7 country. Our share of world exports 
has fallen by almost a third. a sustainable 
recovery must be driven by growth in exports 
and business investment, and through a better 
environment for wealth creation. </p>

<h3 id="make_britain_the_leading_hi_tech_exporter_in_europe">Make Britain the Leading Hi-Tech Exporter in Europe</h3>

<p>We will implement key recommendations from 
Sir james Dyson’s review into how to achieve 
our goal of making britain europe’s leading 
hi-tech exporter, including: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>encouraging the establishment of joint university-business research and 
development institutes; </p></li>
<li><p>initiating a multi-year Science and research  budget to provide a stable investment climate 
for research Councils; </p></li>
<li><p>Creating a better focus on Science,  technology, engineering and maths 
(STEM) subjects in schools; and, </p></li>
<li><p>establishing a new prize for engineering. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Research and development tax credits will be 
improved and refocused on hi-tech companies, 
small businesses and new start-ups. at the 
same time, we will give strong backing to the 
growth industries that generate high-quality 
jobs around the country. </p>

<p>We will improve the performance of UK 
trade and investment with a renewed focus 
on high priority sectors and markets where 
the return on taxpayers’ money is highest. We 
will regularly compare government support for 
exporters and inward investment against the 
services provided by our competitors. We will 
work for the successful conclusion of the Doha 
trade round and support bilateral free trade 
negotiations between the European Union (EU) 
and other countries.</p>

<h3 id="encourage_saving_and_investment">Encourage Saving and  Investment</h3>

<p>Only by saving more can we finance 
investment for the future without being 
dependent on unsustainable inflows of capital 
from abroad. We will help stop the spread of 
means-testing by restoring the link between 
the basic state pension and average earnings, 
making it worthwhile for people to save. other 
measures we will take to encourage saving 
include: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>reinvigorating occupational pensions and working with employers and industry to 
support auto-enrolment into pensions; </p></li>
<li><p>working with the trade unions, businesses and others to address the growing disparity 
between public sector pensions and private 
sector pensions, while protecting accrued 
rights; and, </p></li>
<li><p>when resources allow, starting to reverse the effects of the abolition of the dividend tax 
credit for pension funds. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will reward those who have saved for
their retirement by ending the effective 
obligation to buy an annuity at age 75. and
we will raise the inheritance tax threshold
to £1 million to help millions of people who
aspire to pass something on to their children, 
paid for by a simple flat-rate levy on all
non-domiciled individuals. </p>

<p>We must not let the mis-selling of financial 
products put people off saving. We will 
implement the ombudsman’s recommendation 
to make fair and transparent payments to 
equitable Life policy holders, through an 
independent payment scheme, for their relative 
loss as a consequence of regulatory failure. </p>

<h3 id="help_households_manage_their_debts">Help Households Manage Their Debts</h3>

<p>Going into the recession, Britain’s consumer 
debt was the highest in the g7. a Conservative 
government will promote responsible consumer 
finance by creating a powerful Consumer 
Protection Agency (CPA) to take over the 
financial Services authority’s consumer 
protection role. in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Give the CPA new powers to define and ban excessive borrowing rates on store cards; </p></li>
<li><p>launch Britain’s first free national financial advice service, funded in full through a
new social responsibility levy on the 
financial services sector; </p></li>
<li><p>introduce a seven-day cooling off period for store cards; </p></li>
<li><p>require credit card companies to provide  clear information; and, </p></li>
<li><p>ensure that no-one is forced to sell their home to pay unsecured debts of less
than £25,000.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="debbie_scott">Debbie Scott</h4>

<p>“I’ve always believed that we’ll only solve our big social and economic problems if we 
all get involved and try and make a difference. it’s never enough just to sit back and 
think ‘well the government can take care of it’ – i think we’ve all got a responsibility 
to do what we can. that’s why every day, my colleagues and i use all the innovation 
and fl exibility we can muster to help those furthest from the labour market to 
overcome their personal barriers to work. for me, it is all about believing in the power 
of people. tomorrow’s People welcomes the concept of the single Work Programme – 
it pulls everything together and allows organisations like ours to support people more 
effectively on their individual journey from welfare into work.” </p>

<p>Debbie Scott is the Chief Executive of Tomorrow’s People, a national employment charity founded in 1984</p>

<h3 id="get_britain_working_again">Get Britain Working Again</h3>

<p>We will reduce youth unemployment and reduce the number of children in workless 
households as part of our strategy for tackling poverty and inequality. </p>

<p>Under Labour, youth unemployment has 
reached over 900,000, with one in fi ve 
young people unable to fi nd a job. We are at 
risk of creating a lost generation of young 
people without the skills to participate in the 
workforce, without hope for the future. at the 
same time, economic inactivity is rising, and 
more than five million people are out of work 
and on benefits. </p>

<p>This tidal wave of worklessness is making it 
hard for many families to make ends meet. in 
recent years, the number of people living in 
severe poverty has risen. One in six children in 
the UK now lives in a workless household – the 
highest proportion of any country in europe – 
and child poverty has gone up in recent years. 
getting people back into work is an essential 
part of realising the goal of eliminating child 
poverty by 2020, and ensuring that everyone 
benefi ts from economic growth. </p>

<h4 id="reduce_welfare_dependency">Reduce Welfare Dependency</h4>

<p>We will scrap Labour’s failing employment 
schemes and create a single Work Programme 
for everyone who is unemployed, including the 
2.6 million people claiming incapacity </p>

<p>Benefit who do not get enough help from 
existing programmes. We will reassess all 
current claimants of Incapacity Benefi t. 
Those found fi t for work will be transferred 
onto jobseeker’s allowance. recipients of 
Incapacity Benefi t who are genuinely disabled 
will continue to receive the fi nancial support to 
which they are entitled. our Work Programme 
will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>offer people targeted, personalised help sooner – straight away for those with serious 
barriers to work and at six months for those 
aged under 25; </p></li>
<li><p>be delivered through private and voluntary sector providers, which will be rewarded on 
a payment by results basis for getting people 
into sustainable work; </p></li>
<li><p>draw on a range of Service academies to offer pre-employment training for 
unemployed people – our fi rst Service 
academy, for hospitality and leisure, will 
provide up to 50,000 training places and 
work placements; and,</p></li>
<li><p>involve the development of local Work  Clubs – places where people looking
for work can gather together to exchange 
skills, find opportunities, make useful 
contacts and provide mutual support. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our plans will give unemployed people a hand 
up, not a hand out. Unemployed people must 
be prepared to take up job offers. So, with the 
Conservatives, long-term benefit claimants 
who fail to find work will be required to ‘work 
for the dole’ on community work programmes. 
anyone on jobseeker’s allowance who refuses 
to join the Work Programme will lose the right 
to claim out-of-work benefits until they do, 
while people who refuse to accept reasonable 
job offers could forfeit their benefits for up to 
three years. this will create a welfare system 
that is fair but firm. </p>

<h4 id="boost_small_business">Boost Small Business</h4>

<p>In the end, it is not the state that creates 
sustainable employment – it is business people. 
and small businesses are especially important 
to the UK’s economic recovery and to tackling 
unemployment. government can help boost 
enterprise by lowering tax rates, reducing 
regulation and improving workers’ skills. </p>

<p>As well as stopping Labour’s jobs tax, for the 
first two years of a Conservative government 
any new business will pay no employers 
National Insurance on the first ten employees it 
hires during its first year.</p>

<p>To support small businesses further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make small business rate relief automatic; and, </p></li>
<li><p>Aim to deliver 25 per cent of government research and procurement contracts through 
Smes by cutting the administrative costs of 
bidding. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will support would-be entrepreneurs 
through a new programme – Work for Yourself 
– which will give unemployed people direct 
access to business mentors and substantial 
loans. We need to make work pay, so we will 
keep the minimum wage and work to reduce 
the very high marginal tax rates faced by many 
people on low incomes who want to   will look 
at how to abolish the default retirement age, as 
many older people want to carry on working. 
and we will force equal pay audits on any 
company found to be discriminating on the 
basis of gender. </p>

<h4 id="improve_skills_and_strengthen_higher_education">Improve Skills and Strengthen Higher Education</h4>

<p>Developing economies are able to provide 
highly-skilled work at a fraction of the cost 
of british labour. the only way we can 
compete is by dramatically improving the 
skills of Britain’s workforce, yet thousands 
of young people leave school every year 
without the skills they need to get a good job. a Conservative government will not 
accept another generation being consigned 
to an uncertain future of worklessness and 
dependency. </p>

<p>We will promote fair access to universities,
the professions, and good jobs for young people 
from all backgrounds. We will use funding 
that currently supports Labour’s ineffective 
employment and training schemes, such as 
train2gain, to provide our own help for people 
looking to improve their skills. this will allow 
us to: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>create 400,000 work pairing, apprenticeship, college and training places over two years; </p></li>
<li><p>give Smes a £2,000 bonus for every apprentice they hire; </p></li>
<li><p>establish a Community Learning fund to help people restart their careers; and, </p></li>
<li><p>create a new all-age careers service so that everyone can access the advice they need. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>To meet the skills challenge we face, the 
training sector needs to be given the freedom 
to innovate. We will set colleges free from 
direct state control and abolish many of the 
further education quangos Labour have put in 
place. Public funding will follow the choices of 
students and be delivered by a single agency, 
the further education funding Council. </p>

<p>Universities contribute enormously to the 
economy. but not all of this contribution comes 
directly – it can come from fundamental 
research with no immediate application – and 
universities also have a crucial cultural role. 
We will ensure that britain’s universities enjoy 
the freedom to pursue academic excellence 
and focus on raising the quality of the student 
experience. To enable this to happen, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>delay the implementation of the research Excellence Framework so that it can be 
reviewed – because of doubts about whether 
there is a robust and acceptable way of 
measuring the impact of all research; </p></li>
<li><p>consider carefully the results of Lord browne’s review into the future of higher 
education funding, so that we can unlock 
the potential of universities to transform our 
economy, to enrich students’ lives through 
teaching of the highest quality, and to 
advance scholarship; and, </p></li>
<li><p>provide 10,000 extra university places this year, paid for by giving graduates incentives 
to pay back their student loans early on an 
entirely voluntary basis.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="silicon_valley">Silicon valley</h5>

<p>Despite having a population twenty times smaller than the UK, Silicon Valley is a global 
beacon for innovation and enterprise, attracting more venture capital investment than 
the whole of the UK. Having led the internet revolution, Silicon Valley is now becoming 
a world leader in green technology development. these successes are thanks to the 
highly skilled workforce and world-class universities, the ease of starting a business, and 
the availability of credit and investment. in addition, companies in Silicon valley have 
been able to attract employees in a highly competitive labour market by introducing 
measures to improve the general well-being of their staff, including fl exible working and 
childcare facilities.</p>

<h3 id="encourage_enterprise">Encourage Enterprise</h3>

<p>We will improve Britain’s international rankings for tax competitiveness and business regulation. </p>

<p>Thirteen years ago, Britain’s tax system was 
one of the most competitive in the developed 
world. over the last decade, other countries 
have cut their tax rates while our tax system has 
become one of the most complex in the world. 
our competitiveness rating has fallen, while the 
burden of regulation and the impact of taxation 
have risen. We can only make a sustainable 
economic recovery if we send a clear signal that 
britain is open for business again. that means 
stopping Labour’s jobs tax, lowering corporate 
tax rates, reducing the regulatory burden, 
and supporting innovation and sustainable 
development – changes that will benefit 
businesses of all sizes and boost employment. </p>

<h4 id="cut_and_simplify_business_taxes">Cut and simplify business taxes</h4>

<p>The Conservative Party believes in lower and 
simpler taxation. That is why we will ensure 
that by far the largest part of the burden of 
dealing with the deficit falls on lower spending 
rather than higher taxes. Cutting the deficit is 
the most urgent task we need to undertake if 
we are to get the economy moving, but it is not 
enough. So, initially, we will cut the headline 
rate of corporation tax to 25p and the small 
companies’ rate to 20p, funded by reducing 
complex reliefs and allowances. </p>

<p>Over time, we hope to reduce these rates 
further. our ambition is to create the most 
competitive tax system in the G20 within
five years. </p>

<p>We will restore the tax system’s reputation for 
simplicity, stability and predictability. in our 
first Budget, we will set out a five year road 
map for the direction of corporate tax reform, 
providing greater certainty and stability to 
businesses. We will create an independent 
Office of Tax Simplification to suggest reforms 
to the tax system. </p>

<p>We will take a series of measures to encourage 
Foreign Direct Investment into the UK, 
including: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>making the UK a more attractive location for multinationals by simplifying the complex 
Controlled foreign Companies rules; </p></li>
<li><p>consulting on moving towards a territorial corporate tax system that only taxes profits 
generated in the UK; and, </p></li>
<li><p>creating an attractive tax environment for intellectual property.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reduce_regulation">Reduce Regulation</h3>

<p>Increasing amounts of red tape and complex 
regulation have eroded britain’s reputation 
as a good place to invest, create jobs or start 
a business. a Conservative government will 
introduce regulatory budgets: forcing any 
government body wanting to introduce a new 
regulation to reduce regulation elsewhere by a 
greater amount. and we will give the public the 
opportunity to force the worst regulations to be 
repealed. </p>

<p>To encourage new businesses to start up, we 
will reduce the number of forms needed to 
register a new business – moving towards a 
‘one-click’ registration model – to make britain 
the fastest place in the world to start a business, 
and end the restrictions on social tenants 
starting a business from their homes. </p>

<p>We are proud of the last Conservative 
government’s industrial relations reforms, 
which helped bring about our economic revival 
in the 1980s, and we will always be prepared to 
build on them if necessary. </p>

<h4 id="support_innovation_and_sustainable_development">Support Innovation and Sustainable Development</h4>

<p>Government procurement is a £200 billion a 
year market that can be used much better to 
stimulate enterprise and innovation. We will 
take steps to open up government procurement 
to small and innovative businesses by: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>publishing online all government tender documents for contracts worth over £10,000  via the Supply2gov website; </p></li>
<li><p>creating a level playing field for open source ICT in government procurement; and, </p></li>
<li><p>opening up contracts to Smes by breaking  up large iCt projects into smaller 
components. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Britain’s complex and unwieldy planning 
system has long been cited as a significant 
barrier to growth and wealth creation. We will 
create a presumption in favour of sustainable 
development in the planning system. We will 
abolish the unelected infrastructure Planning 
Commission (IPC) and replace it with an 
efficient and democratically-accountable 
system that provides a fast-track process for 
major infrastructure projects. We will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>use private or hybrid bills to promote major projects, such as our plans for a national high 
speed rail network; </p></li>
<li><p>ensure that all other major infrastructure projects are considered at planning inquiries 
which have binding timetables and which 
focus on planning issues – with final 
permission given by a minister; and, </p></li>
<li><p>provide transitional arrangements for projects  already before the iPC to ensure that these 
projects are not disrupted or delayed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attract_the_brightest_and_best_to_our_country">Attract the Brightest and Best to Our Country</h3>

<p>Immigration has enriched our nation over the 
years and we want to attract the brightest and 
the best people who can make a real difference 
to our economic growth. but immigration 
today is too high and needs to be reduced. We 
do not need to attract people to do jobs that 
could be carried out by british citizens, given 
the right training and support. So we will take 
steps to take net migration back to the levels 
of the 1990s – tens of thousands a year, not 
hundreds of thousands. </p>

<p>Yo help achieve this goal, we will introduce a 
number of measures, such as: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>setting an annual limit on the number of non-EU economic migrants admitted into the UK 
to live and work; </p></li>
<li><p>limiting access only to those who will bring the most value to the british economy; and, </p></li>
<li><p>applying transitional controls as a matter of course in the future for all new eU member 
States. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, we will promote integration into 
british society, as we believe that everyone 
coming to this country must be ready to 
embrace our core values and become a part 
of their local community. So there will be an 
english language test for anyone coming here 
to get married. </p>

<p>We want to encourage students to come to our 
universities and colleges, but our student visa 
system has become the biggest weakness in our 
border controls. a Conservative government 
will strengthen the system of granting student 
visas so that it is less open to abuse. We want 
to make it easier for reputable universities and 
colleges to accept applications, while putting 
extra scrutiny on new institutions looking to 
accept foreign students or existing institutions 
not registered with Companies house. in 
addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>insist foreign students at new or unregistered institutions pay a bond in order to study in 
this country, to be repaid after the student
has left the country at the end of their studies; </p></li>
<li><p>ensure foreign students can prove that they have the financial means to support 
themselves in the UK; and, </p></li>
<li><p>require that students must usually leave the country and reapply if they want to switch
to another course or apply for a work permit.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ensure_the_whole_country_shares_in_rising_prosperity">Ensure the Whole Country Shares in Rising Prosperity</h3>

<p>We will increase the private sector’s share of the economy in all regions of the country, especially 
outside London and the South East. </p>

<p>Too many areas of the UK lack a vibrant 
private sector and are too dependent on public 
spending. these regional imbalances have got 
worse over the last decade, despite billions of 
pounds spent by the regional Development 
Agencies (RDAs). Our aim is to increase the 
private sector’s share of the economy in every 
part of the country by boosting enterprise and 
creating a better business environment. We 
will work closely with local government, and 
with the Scottish Parliament, Welsh assembly 
and northern ireland assembly, to achieve 
this goal.</p>

<h4 id="create_a_modern_transport_network">Create a Modern Transport Network</h4>

<p>A rebalanced economy requires an extensive 
and reliable infrastructure. but transport has 
been a low priority for Labour, and the hassle 
of getting around is bad for business, bad for 
families and bad for everyone’s quality of life. </p>

<p>A Conservative government will begin work 
immediately to create a high speed rail line 
connecting London and Heathrow with 
birmingham, manchester and Leeds. this is 
the first step towards achieving our vision of 
creating a national high speed rail network to join up major cities across england, Scotland 
and Wales. Stage two will deliver two new lines 
bringing the north east, Scotland and Wales 
into the high speed rail network. </p>

<p>Because travel abroad is so important for 
our economy and for family holidays, we 
need to improve our airports and reduce the 
environmental impact of fl ying. Our goal is 
to make heathrow airport better, not bigger. 
We will stop the third runway and instead 
link heathrow directly to our high speed rail 
network, providing an alternative to thousands 
of fl ights. In addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>block plans for second runways at Stansted and gatwick; and, </li>
<li>reform air Passenger Duty to encourage a switch to fuller and cleaner planes. </li>
</ul>

<p>To improve life for commuters and encourage 
people to switch to lower carbon public 
transport, we will reform our railways to 
provide a better focus on tackling problems 
that matter most to passengers, such as 
overcrowding. We will grant longer, more 
fl exible rail franchises to incentivise private 
sector investment in improvements like longer 
trains and better stations.</p>

<p>We support Crossrail and the electrification of 
the great Western line to South Wales. We will 
turn the rail regulator into a powerful passenger 
champion and reform network rail to make it 
more accountable to its customers. and we will 
introduce a moratorium on building on disused 
rail lines still in public ownership, so they are 
available to be re-opened. </p>

<p>Britain has the chance to lead the world in 
making our transport system greener. So we 
will introduce incentives for electricity network 
operators to establish a new national car 
recharging network, making it much easier
for drivers to move to electric and plug-in 
hybrid vehicles. We will support sustainable 
travel initiatives that work best for local 
communities by: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>giving the concerns of cyclists much  greater priority; </p></li>
<li><p>encouraging partnerships between  bus operators and local authorities; and, </p></li>
<li><p>helping people cut down on work-related travel. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will stop central government funding 
for new fixed speed cameras, and switch to 
more effective ways to make our roads safer, 
including authorising ‘drugalyser’ technology 
for use in testing for drug-driving. We 
will make companies that dig up our roads 
accountable for the congestion they cause and 
crack down on rogue clampers. Councils will 
get more powers to get traffic flowing more 
smoothly. </p>

<p>We will consult on the introduction of a ‘fair 
fuel Stabiliser’. this would cut fuel duty 
when oil prices rise, and vice versa. it would 
ensure families, businesses and the whole 
British economy are less exposed to volatile 
oil markets, and that there is a more stable 
environment for low carbon investment. </p>

<h4 id="spread_prosperity">Spread prosperity</h4>

<p>We want britain to become a european hub 
for hi-tech, digital and creative industries – 
but this can only happen if we have the right 
infrastructure in place. establishing a super- 
fast broadband network throughout the UK 
could generate 600,000 additional jobs and add 
£18 billion to britain’s gDP. </p>

<p>We will scrap Labour’s phone tax and instead 
require bt and other infrastructure providers 
to allow the use of their assets to deliver super- 
fast broadband across the country. if necessary, 
we will consider using the part of the licence 
fee that is supporting the digital switchover to 
fund broadband in areas that the market alone 
will not reach. </p>

<p>We will give councils and businesses the power 
to form their own business-led local enterprise 
partnerships instead of rDas. Where local 
councils and businesses want to maintain 
regionally-based enterprise partnerships, they will be able to. Local government should be at 
the heart of our economic recovery, so we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>allow councils to keep above-average increases in business rate revenue so that 
communities which go for growth can reap 
the benefits; </p></li>
<li><p>give councils new powers to introduce further discounts on business rates; </p></li>
<li><p>and, introduce an immediate freeze of, and inquiry into, the government’s punitive 
programme of back-dating business rates
on ports.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reform_public_services_to_deliver_better_value_for_money">Reform Public Services to Deliver Better Value for Money</h3>

<p>We will raise productivity growth in the public sector in order to deliver better schools 
and a better nhs. </p>

<p>Public sector productivity has fallen under 
Labour, acting as a drag on growth and 
reducing the quality of our public services. 
if productivity in the public sector had grown 
at the same rate as in private sector services, 
we could now have the same quality of public 
services for £60 billion less each year. So, by 
improving public sector productivity while 
getting a grip on the debt, we will still be 
able to deliver better public services. that 
is why good government costs less with the 
Conservatives. </p>

<h4 id="decentralisation_accountability_and_transparency">Decentralisation, Accountability and Transparency</h4>

<p>We value the work of those employed in 
our public services, and a Conservative 
government will work with them to deliver 
higher productivity and better value for 
money for taxpayers. We will raise public 
sector productivity by increasing diversity of 
provision, extending payment by results and 
giving more power to consumers. </p>

<p>Giving public sector workers ownership of the 
services they deliver is a powerful way to drive 
efficiency, so we will support co-operatives and 
mutualisation as a way of transferring public 
assets and revenue streams to public sector 
workers. We will encourage them to come 
together to form employee-led co-operatives 
and bid to take over the services they run. this 
will empower millions of public sector workers 
to become their own boss and help them to 
deliver better services – the most signifi cant 
shift in power from the state to working people 
since the sale of council houses in the 1980s. </p>

<p>Transparency is crucial to creating a value for 
money culture. We will publish all items of 
spending over £25,000 online, and the salaries 
of senior civil servants in central government 
will also be published. We will create strong 
fi nancial discipline at all levels of government 
and place an obligation to manage taxpayers’ 
money wisely at the heart of civil service 
employment contracts. in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>introduce and publish a standard set of cost measures that capture the key drivers of 
departmental spending; </p></li>
<li><p>help departmental finance Directors to manage resources more efficiently; </p></li>
<li><p>implement clear financial performance targets for senior civil servants; and, </p></li>
<li>create a focus on delivering strong financial management across government.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create_a_safer_banking_system_that_serves_the_needs_of_the_economy">Create a Safer Banking System That Serves the Needs of the Economy</h3>

<p>We will reform the regulation and structure of the banking system to ensure lower levels of leverage, 
less dependence on unstable wholesale funding, and greater availability of credit for SMEs. </p>

<p>In the run up to the fi nancial crisis, British 
banks became amongst the most indebted and 
most leveraged in the world – with disastrous 
consequences for us all. this credit boom 
turned into a bust, with a signifi cant fall in 
credit available to fi rms. Lack of access to 
credit remains a major problem, especially for 
Smes. We need to change the way we regulate 
our banks to stop a crisis on this scale ever 
happening again. </p>

<h4 id="reform_financial_services">Reform financial services</h4>

<p>The financial services sector is one of our most 
globally successful industries, and we want 
the City to be the leading location for global 
fi nance. But the fi nancial sector must not put the 
stability of the whole economy at risk. </p>

<p>We will put in place a levy on banks. We are 
prepared to act unilaterally if necessary, but 
there is emerging international agreement 
on this approach and the US and german 
governments have both announced similar 
plans. </p>

<p>We need fundamental reform of our 
failed regulatory system, avoiding badly- 
designed regulations that will damage our 
competitiveness and ensuring that the fi nancial 
sector can supply the affordable credit that 
businesses need. </p>

<p>We will abolish gordon brown’s failed tripartite 
system of regulation and put the bank of england 
in charge of prudential supervision. We will 
restore the bank’s historic role in monitoring 
the overall growth of credit and debt in the 
economy. in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>pursue international agreement to prevent retail banks from engaging in activities, such 
as large-scale proprietary trading, that put 
the stability of the system at risk; </p></li>
<li><p>empower the bank of england to crack down on risky bonus arrangements; </p></li>
<li><p>increase competition in the banking industry, starting with a study of competition in the 
sector to inform our strategy for selling the 
government’s stakes in the banks; and, </p></li>
<li><p>as the government comes to sell off its holdings in the banks, offer a ‘people’s bank bonus’, so 
that everybody in the country has the chance 
to buy a stake in the state-owned banks. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will create more diverse sources of affordable 
credit for small businesses, building on our 
proposals for a national Loan guarantee Scheme.</p>

<h5 id="japan">Japan</h5>

<p>Japan is a world leader in the development of green technology. it invests 
in R&amp;D at almost double the UK’s rate, and Japanese companies hold 
roughly 30 per cent of green technology patents fi led in the US. As a 
result, Japan is far ahead of the UK in the trillion pound market for green 
technology. this leadership is not just good for the economy; it’s also good 
for the environment. For example, thanks to the widespread use of green 
technologies, japan has the lowest carbon intensity of any major economy.</p>

<h3 id="build_a_greener_economy">Build a Greener Economy</h3>

<p>We will reduce Uk greenhouse gas emissions and increase our share of global markets for low 
carbon technologies. </p>

<p>Labour have said the right things on climate 
change, but these have proved little more than 
warm words. Despite three White Papers, 
a multitude of strategies and endless new 
announcements, the UK now gets more of its 
energy from fossil fuels than it did in 1997. our 
performance on emissions has been criticised 
by environmental groups and we have the worst 
record of any major EU nation when it comes 
to renewable energy. this must change to 
safeguard britain and the world’s future. </p>

<p>We need to cut our carbon emissions to tackle 
the challenge of climate change. but the 
low carbon economy also provides exciting 
opportunities for british businesses. We will 
encourage private sector investment to put 
britain at the forefront of the green technology 
revolution, creating jobs and new businesses 
across the country. </p>

<h3 id="create_a_low_carbon_future">Create a low carbon future</h3>

<p>This wave of low carbon innovation we want 
to unleash requires investment, so we will 
create Britain’s fi rst Green Investment Bank 
– which will draw together money currently 
divided across existing government initiatives, 
leveraging private sector capital to fi nance 
new green technology start-ups. We will create 
green individual Savings accounts to help 
provide the fi nancial backing we need to create 
a low carbon economy. </p>

<p>A credible and sustainable price for carbon 
is vital if we are to see adequate and timely 
investment in new electricity generation. 
Whatever the carbon content of electricity 
generated, operators considering new 
investments in projects with a life of several 
decades need to know where they stand. We 
will reform the Climate Change Levy to 
provide a fl oor price for carbon, delivering 
the right climate for investment in low carbon 
energy production. </p>

<p>We will increase the proportion of tax revenues 
accounted for by environmental taxes, ensuring 
that any additional revenues from new green 
taxes that are principally designed as an 
environmental measure to change behaviour 
are used to reduce the burden of taxation 
elsewhere.</p>

<h5 id="aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</h5>

<p>Aberystwyth is an important cultural and 
education centre. aberystwyth University has 
over 12,000 students and is one of the leading 
universities in the country. the national 
Library of Wales is based in aberystwyth, as 
are the Welsh Books Council and the offi ces 
of the Dictionary of the Welsh language, 
geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru. aberystwyth has 
a range of neighbourhoods – from victorian 
terraces to 1960s suburban semis. over 70 per 
cent of british people live in suburbs, which are 
a defi ning feature of modern Britain. Suburbs 
play a vital role in the success of britain’s 
cities, providing housing and green spaces for 
millions of families. Suburbs are places where 
a sense of community can fl ourish, and where 
people raise children and play an active part in 
neighbourhood groups.</p>

<h1 id="change_society">Change society</h1>

<h3 id="mend_our_broken_society">Mend Our Broken Society</h3>

<p>our society is broken, but together we can mend it: we can build the Big society. a conservative 
government will make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will back the NHS, 
which matters more to families than anything. We will reform education, with new schools – and 
higher standards and improved discipline for all. We will tackle welfare dependency and the 
causes of poverty, and fight back against crime. </p>

<p>Despite Labour’s massive expansion of the state, many people’s quality of life is getting worse, 
not better. the number of people living in poverty has risen in the last three years, and inequality
is at a record high. We have some of the worst rates of family breakdown in the world. in some
of the most deprived parts of the country, life expectancy has actually fallen. The achievement
gap at school between the richest and poorest is growing. </p>

<p>This terrible record of failure is not just a problem that affects our society and ruins people’s 
lives. it affects our economy too, costing billions and wasting potential. it is the result of a political 
approach that addresses the symptoms, rather than the underlying causes, of social breakdown;
one that relies on top-down government intervention and bureaucratic micro-management. </p>

<p>So we need a new approach: social responsibility, not state control; the big Society, not big 
government. only in this way will we tackle the causes of poverty and inequality, rather than just 
the symptoms. only in this way will we transform the quality of our public services. and only in 
this way will we rebuild shattered communities and repair the torn fabric of society. </p>

<p>So we will redistribute power from the central state to individuals, families and local 
communities. We will give public sector workers back their professional autonomy. they will 
be accountable to the people they serve and the results they achieve will be made transparent. if 
people don’t like the service they receive they will be able to choose better alternatives. in this way, 
we will create opportunities for people to take power and control over their lives. our approach is 
absolutely in line with the spirit of the age: the post-bureaucratic age. </p>

<p>This vision demands a cultural change across the country. our success will depend not just on 
the actions we take but on society’s response. by promoting equality and tackling discrimination, 
our policies, like recognising civil partnerships as well as marriage in the tax system and helping 
disabled people live independently, will give everybody the chance to play their part. this way,
we can make britain fairer and safer; a country where opportunity is more equal.</p>

<h3 id="build_the_big_society">Build the Big Society</h3>

<p>We will use the state to help stimulate social action, helping social enterprises to deliver public 
services and training new community organisers to help achieve our ambition of every adult 
citizen being a member of an active neighbourhood group. We will direct funding to those groups 
that strengthen communities in deprived areas, and we will introduce National Citizen Service, 
initially for 16 year olds, to help bring our country together. </p>

<p>The size, scope and role of government in 
the UK has reached a point where it is now 
inhibiting, not advancing, the progressive aims 
of reducing poverty, fighting inequality, and 
increasing general well-being. We can’t go on 
pretending that government has all the answers. </p>

<p>Our alternative to big government is the big 
Society: a society with much higher levels of 
personal, professional, civic and corporate 
responsibility; a society where people come 
together to solve problems and improve life
for themselves and their communities; a society 
where the leading force for progress is social 
responsibility, not state control. </p>

<p>The big Society runs consistently through
our policy programme. our plans to reform 
public services, mend our broken society, 
and rebuild trust in politics are all part of 
our big Society agenda. these plans involve 
redistributing power from the state to society; 
from the centre to local communities, giving 
people the opportunity to take more control 
over their lives. </p>

<p>But we recognise that it is not enough to create 
opportunities for people to get involved in 
building the big Society; our reform plans 
require a social response in order to be 
successful. So building the big Society is not 
just a question of the state stepping back and 
hoping for the best: it will require an active 
role for the state. the state must take action 
to agitate for, catalyse and galvanise social 
renewal. We must use the state to help 
remake society. </p>

<h4 id="public_service_reform">Public service reform</h4>

<p>Our public service reform programme will 
enable social enterprises, charities and 
voluntary groups to play a leading role in 
delivering public services and tackling
deep-rooted social problems. </p>

<p>We will strengthen and support social 
enterprises to help deliver our public service 
reforms by creating a big Society bank, funded 
from unclaimed bank assets, to provide
new finance for neighbourhood groups, 
charities, social enterprises and other non- 
governmental bodies.</p>

<p>This will provide social enterprises with the 
start-up funding and support they need to
bid for government contracts or work towards 
delivering services under a payment by
results model. </p>

<p>britain has a proud and long-standing 
charitable tradition, and we are convinced 
that the voluntary sector should play a major 
part in our civic renewal. We will introduce 
a fair deal on grants to give voluntary sector 
organisations more stability and allow them to 
earn a competitive return for providing public 
services. We will work with local authorities to 
promote the delivery of public services by social 
enterprises, charities and the voluntary sector. </p>

<h4 id="neighbourhood_groups">neighbourhood groups</h4>

<p>our reform agenda is designed to empower 
communities to come together to address local 
issues. For example, we will enable parents 
to start new schools, empower communities 
to take over local amenities such as parks 
and libraries that are under threat, give 
neighbourhoods greater control of the planning 
system, and enable residents to hold the police 
to account in neighbourhood beat meetings. 
these policies will give new powers and rights 
to neighbourhood groups: the ‘little platoons’ 
of civil society – and the institutional building 
blocks of the big Society. </p>

<p>our ambition is for every adult in the country 
to be a member of an active neighbourhood 
group. We will stimulate the creation and 
development of neighbourhood groups, which 
can take action to improve their local area. We 
will use Cabinet Office budgets to fund the 
training of independent community organisers 
to help people establish and run neighbourhood 
groups, and provide neighbourhood grants to 
the UK’s poorest areas to ensure they play a 
leading role in the rebuilding of civic society. </p>

<p>to stimulate social action further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>transform the civil service into a ‘civic service’ by making sure that participation
in social action is recognised in civil 
servants’ appraisals; </p></li>
<li><p>launch an annual big Society Day to celebrate the work of neighbourhood groups 
and encourage more people to take part
in social action; </p></li>
<li><p>provide funding from the big Society bank to intermediary bodies with a track record
of supporting and growing social enterprises; 
and, </p></li>
<li><p>develop a measure of well-being that encapsulates the social value of state action.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="national_citizen_service">National Citizen Service</h4>

<p>building the big Society means encouraging 
the concept of public-spirited service – the idea 
that everyone should play a part in making their 
communities stronger. </p>

<p>that is why we will introduce national Citizen 
Service. The initial flagship project will provide 
a programme for 16 year olds to give them a 
chance to develop the skills needed to be active 
and responsible citizens, mix with people 
from different backgrounds, and start getting 
involved in their communities. </p>

<p>Even in these difficult times, the British people 
have demonstrated their desire to give money 
and time to good causes. We will introduce 
new ways to increase philanthropy, and use the 
latest insights from behavioural economics to 
encourage people to make volunteering and 
community participation something they do
on a regular basis. </p>

<h4 id="the_national_lottery">The National Lottery</h4>

<p>We will restore the national Lottery to its 
original purpose and, by cutting down on 
administration costs, make sure more money 
goes to good causes. the big Lottery fund 
will focus purely on supporting social action 
through the voluntary and community sector, 
instead of ministers’ pet projects as at present. 
Sports, heritage and the arts will each see their 
original allocations of 20 per cent of good cause 
money restored. </p>

<h4 id="sport_and_the_olympics">Sport and the Olympics</h4>

<p>We will deliver a successful olympics that 
brings lasting benefits for the country as a 
whole. Part of the community sports budget 
of the national Lottery will be responsible 
for delivering an olympic legacy, including 
the vigorous promotion of competitive sports 
through a national olympic-style school 
competition. to support high-level sport 
further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>work with the Scottish government to deliver a top-quality Commonwealth games in 
glasgow in 2014; </p></li>
<li><p>ensure that the 2013 rugby League and the 2015 rugby Union World Cups are 
successful; and, </p></li>
<li><p>strongly support england’s bid to host the 2018 football World Cup.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="julie_fallon">Julie Fallon</h5>

<p>“i went to a ‘Cameron Direct’ meeting in our local town hall where David Cameron 
answered questions from members of the public – and one thing he said that really 
took hold with me was that he wanted britain to be one of the most family-friendly 
countries… i think that’s just a great outlook to have – how brilliant would it be if 
we could achieve that? i think that the tories have some great ideas and i believe 
that their policies on family, especially on fl exible working, are the best thing for 
my future and for my children’s future.” </p>

<p>julie fallon lives in Llandudno, Wales, with her husband and two children</p>

<h3 id="make_britain_the_most_family_friendly_country_in_europe">make britain the most family-friendly country in europe</h3>

<p>We will make Britain the most family-friendly country in Europe. We will support families in the 
tax and benefits system, extend flexible working and improve parental leave. We will help parents 
cope with the commercialisation of childhood and give families more control over their lives.
We will support and improve Sure Start, and introduce a new universal health visiting service.
We will give targeted help to disadvantaged and dysfunctional families. </p>

<p>Strong families are the bedrock of a strong 
society. they provide the stability and love 
we need to flourish as human beings, and the 
relationships they foster are the foundation on 
which society is built. the warmth of a child’s 
parenting is as important to their life chances as 
the wealth of their upbringing. </p>

<p>Labour’s complacent attitude to commitment 
has done untold harm, and their narrow 
approach ignores the importance of 
strengthening the relationships between 
all family members – children, parents, 
grandparents and the wider family. as a result, 
britain is one of the least family-friendly 
countries in the world. </p>

<p>this will change with a Conservative 
government. We will help families with all the 
pressures they face: the lack of time, money 
worries, the impact of work, concerns about 
schools and crime, preventing unhealthy 
influences, poor housing. We will not be neutral 
on this. britain’s families will get our full 
backing across all our policies. </p>

<h4 id="reform_tax_and_benefits_to_help_families_and_pensioners">Reform tax and benefits to help families and pensioners</h4>

<p>today, Labour’s tax and benefits system 
rewards couples who split up. a Conservative 
government will end the couple penalty for
all couples in the tax credit system as we make 
savings from our welfare reform plans. We
will recognise marriage and civil partnerships 
in the tax system in the next Parliament. This 
will send an important signal that we value 
couples and the commitment that people make 
when they get married. </p>

<p>to help britain’s families further, a 
Conservative government will freeze council 
tax for two years, in partnership with local 
councils. this will be paid for by reducing 
spending on government consultants and 
advertising, and could save families and 
pensioners up to £219 over two years on a
band D bill. We will also scrap Labour’s
plans for an expensive and intrusive council
tax revaluation.</p>

<p>We support tax credits and will continue to 
provide the range of tax credits to families, 
although we can no longer justify paying 
tax credits to households earning more than 
£50,000. We will reform the administration of 
tax credits to reduce fraud and overpayments, 
which hit the poorest families hardest. </p>

<p>We strongly value the role older people play in 
families and in society, and will not let them 
suffer because of the economic mistakes of 
others. that is why we have made a pledge
to pensioners to re-link the basic state pension
to earnings, and protect: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the winter fuel payment; </p></li>
<li><p>free bus passes; </p></li>
<li><p>free tv licences; </p></li>
<li><p>disability living allowance and attendance allowance; and, </p></li>
<li>the pension credit. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="give_families_more_control_over_their_lives">Give Families More Control Over Their Lives</h4>

<p>Making britain more family-friendly means 
helping families spend more time together. 
That is why we will initially extend the right to 
request flexible working to every parent with 
a child under the age of eighteen. We want our 
government to lead from the front, so we will 
extend the right to request flexible working to 
all those in the public sector, recognising that 
this may need to be done in stages. in addition, 
we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>in the longer term, extend the right to request flexible working to all, but only in the light 
of experience and after full consultation 
with business on how to do this in a way 
which is administratively simple and without 
burdening them with extra costs; and, </p></li>
<li><p>oblige JobCentre Plus offices to ask employers if their vacancies could be advertised on a 
part-time or flexible basis. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will introduce a new system of flexible 
parental leave which lets parents share maternity 
leave between them, while ensuring that parents 
on leave can stay in touch with their employer. 
We support the provision of free nursery care for 
pre-school children, and we want that support 
to be provided by a diverse range of providers. 
a Conservative government will review the 
way the childcare industry is regulated and 
funded to ensure that no providers, including 
childminders, are put at a disadvantage. </p>

<p>to give families more control over their lives, 
we will put funding for relationship support
on a stable, long-term footing and make sure 
couples are given greater encouragement to use 
existing relationship support. We will review 
family law in order to increase the use of 
mediation when couples do break up, and look
at how best to provide greater access rights
to non-resident parents and grandparents.</p>

<h3 id="protect_childhood">Protect childhood</h3>

<p>Children should be allowed to grow up at their 
own pace, without excessive pressure placed 
on them by businesses. We will take a series of 
measures to help reverse the commercialisation 
of childhood. We prefer to gain voluntary 
consent to these actions but we are prepared to 
legislate if necessary. We will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>prevent any marketing or advertising company found to be in serious breach of 
rules governing marketing to children from 
bidding for government advertising contracts 
for three years; </p></li>
<li><p>ban companies from using new peer-to-peer marketing techniques targeted at children, 
and tackle marketing on corporate websites 
targeted at children; </p></li>
<li><p>establish a new online system that gives parents greater powers to take action against 
irresponsible commercial activities targeted 
at children; and, </p></li>
<li><p>empower head teachers and governors to ban advertising and vending machines in schools. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a_new_approach_to_early_intervention">A New Approach to Early Intervention</h4>

<p>the Conservative Party is committed to 
keeping Sure Start because the network of 
Children’s Centres is of enormous value to 
parents across the country. but we believe Sure 
Start needs to work better because the
people who need it most – disadvantaged
and dysfunctional families – are not getting 
enough of the benefit. </p>

<p>We will take Sure Start back to its original 
purpose of early intervention, increase its
focus on the neediest families, and better 
involve organisations with a track record in 
supporting families. </p>

<p>families need the best possible advice and 
support while their children are young. We will 
provide 4,200 more Sure Start health visitors 
– giving all parents a guaranteed level of 
support before and after birth until their child 
starts school. this will be paid for out of the 
Department of health budget and by refocusing 
Sure Start’s peripatetic outreach services. </p>

<p>to improve the early interventions we make to 
help families, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>ensure that new Sure Start providers are paid in part by the results they achieve; </p></li>
<li><p>bring all funding for early intervention and parenting support into one budget, to be 
overseen by a single, newly-created early 
Years Support team; and, </p></li>
<li><p>set out a new approach to help families with multiple problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="back_the_nhs">Back the NHS</h3>

<p>We will back the NHS. We will increase health spending every year. We will give patients more 
choice and free health professionals from the tangle of politically-motivated targets that get in the 
way of providing the best care. We will give patients better access to the treatments, services and 
information that improve and extend lives, boost the nation’s health, and reform social care. </p>

<p>more than three years ago, David Cameron 
spelled out his priorities in three letters – nhS. 
Since then, we have consistently fought to 
protect the values the nhS stands for and have 
campaigned to defend the nhS from Labour’s 
cuts and reorganisations. as the party of the 
nhS, we will never change the idea at its heart 
– that healthcare in this country is free at the 
point of use and available to everyone based on 
need, not ability to pay. </p>

<p>We have a reform plan to make the changes 
the nhS needs. We will decentralise power, so 
that patients have a real choice. We will make 
doctors and nurses accountable to patients, 
not to endless layers of bureaucracy and 
management. We can’t go on with an nhS that 
puts targets before patients. </p>

<p>We will make the performance of the nhS 
totally transparent by publishing information 
about the kind of results that healthcare 
providers are achieving, so there is no hiding 
place for failure. We will increase access to 
vital drugs and services, and create a greater 
focus on preventing people getting ill in the 
fi rst place. This is how we will achieve our 
ambition for the nhS to deliver some of the 
best healthcare in the world. </p>

<p>We are the party of the nhS today because we 
not only back the values of the nhS, we back 
its funding and have a vision for its future. </p>

<h4 id="give_patients_more_choice">give patients more choice</h4>

<p>We understand the pressures the nhS faces, so 
we will increase health spending in real terms 
every year. but on its own this will not be 
enough to deliver the rising standards of care 
that people expect. We need to allow patients 
to choose the best care available, giving 
healthcare providers the incentives they need to 
drive up quality. </p>

<p>So we will give every patient the power to 
choose any healthcare provider that meets nhS 
standards, within nhS prices. this includes 
independent, voluntary and community sector 
providers. We will make patients’ choices 
meaningful by: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>putting patients in charge of making decisions about their care, including control 
of their health records;</p></li>
<li><p>spreading the use of the nhS tariff, so funding follows patients’ choices; and, </p></li>
<li><ul>
<li>making sure good performance is rewarded by implementing a payment by results 
system, improving quality. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We will publish detailed data about the 
performance of healthcare providers online, so 
everyone will know who is providing a good 
service and who is falling behind, and we 
will measure our success on the health results 
that really matter – such as improving cancer 
and stroke survival rates or reducing hospital 
infections. </p>

<p>Patients will be able to rate hospitals and 
doctors according to the quality of care they 
received. We will give the public a strong and 
independent voice through healthWatch, a 
statutory body with the power to investigate 
and support complaints. </p>

<p>We will strengthen the power of gPs as 
patients’ expert guides through the health 
system by: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>giving them the power to hold patients’ budgets and commission care on their behalf; </p></li>
<li><p>linking their pay to the quality of their results; and, </p></li>
<li><p>putting them in charge of commissioning local health services. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trust_healthcare_professionals">Trust Healthcare Professionals</h4>

<p>Doctors and nurses need to be able to use 
their professional judgement about what is 
right for patients, instead of being forced to 
follow bureaucratic processes that often put 
lives at risk. that is why we will scrap the 
politically-motivated targets that have no 
clinical justification. We will set NHS providers 
free to innovate by ensuring that they become 
autonomous foundation trusts. </p>

<p>We will make sure that funding decisions are 
made on the basis of need, and commissioning 
decisions according to evidence-based quality 
standards, by creating an independent nhS 
board to allocate resources and provide 
commissioning guidelines. We will ensure that 
nhS staff are protected if they raise concerns 
about patient safety. </p>

<p>NHS staff will be properly accountable to 
patients for their performance, removing the 
need for expensive layers of bureaucracy to 
oversee the nhS. as a result, we will be able to 
cut the cost of nhS administration by a third 
and transfer resources to support doctors and 
nurses on the frontline.</p>

<h3 id="increase_access_to_vital_drugs_and_services">Increase Access to Vital Drugs And Services</h3>

<p>People want an nhS that is easy to access at 
any time of day or night. We will commission 
a 24/7 urgent care service in every area of 
england, including gP out of hours services, 
and ensure that every patient can access a gP 
in their area between 8am and 8pm, seven days 
a week. We will introduce a single number for 
every kind of urgent care – to run in parallel 
with the emergency number 999. </p>

<p>We will stop the forced closure of a&amp;e and 
maternity wards, so that people have better 
access to local services, and give mothers a real 
choice over where to have their baby, with nhS 
funding following their decisions. We will 
create local ‘maternity networks’ to ensure that 
mothers can safely access the right care, in the 
right place, at the right time. </p>

<p>When patients are forced to go to hospital, they 
expect the highest standards of cleanliness. 
but infections like mrSa now kill more 
than three times as many people as are killed 
on the roads each year. We will increase 
the number of single rooms in hospitals, as 
resources allow, helping the battle against 
infection and providing safety and privacy. as 
a result, we will end the scandal of mixed-sex 
accommodation – which Labour have failed to 
do. and we will not pay hospitals in full when a 
patient is left with an avoidable infection. </p>

<p>NHS patients rightly expect to be among the 
first in the world to access effective treatments,
but under Labour they are among the last. 
We want more people to access the drugs and 
treatments that would prolong or improve their 
lives by reforming the way drug companies 
are paid for nhS medicines. Using money 
saved by the nhS through our pledge to stop 
Labour’s jobs tax, we will create a Cancer Drug 
fund to enable patients to access the cancer 
drugs their doctors think will help them. </p>

<p>To help the fight against cancer further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>give thousands more people – especially young people – access to effective drugs
to treat rare cancers by changing the way 
these drugs are commissioned; </p></li>
<li><p>encourage clinical trials of innovative techniques to diagnose and treat cancer; and, </p></li>
<li>support the roll out of screening programmes for common cancers. </li>
</ul>

<p>Under Labour, fewer people are able to 
see an nhS dentist. So we will introduce 
a new dentistry contract that will focus on 
achieving good dental health, not simply the 
number of treatments achieved. this will tie 
newly-qualified dentists into the NHS for five 
years and allow dentists to fine people who 
consistently miss appointments. these changes 
will allow us to give one million more people 
access to an NHS dentist and give every five 
year old a dental check-up.</p>

<h3 id="take_control_of_your_care">Take Control of Your Care</h3>

<p>Where possible we want to devolve control 
over health budgets to the lowest possible level, 
so people have more control over their health 
needs. for people with a chronic illness or a 
long-term condition, we will provide access to 
a single budget that combines their health and 
social care funding, which they can tailor to 
their own needs. </p>

<p>The UK’s six million carers play an 
indispensable role in looking after friends 
or family members who need support. not 
only do they provide help to some of the most 
vulnerable people in society, the unpaid work 
they do contributes £87 billion worth of value
a year – sometimes at the cost of carers’ 
finances and even their health. We will support 
carers, and those they look after, by providing 
direct payments to help with care needs and
by improving access to respite care. </p>

<p>We will provide £10 million a year beyond 2011 
to support children’s hospices in their vital 
work. and so that proper support for
the most sick children and adults can
continue in the setting of their choice,
we will introduce a new per-patient funding 
system for all hospices and other providers
of palliative care. </p>

<p>We reject Labour’s plans for a compulsory 
‘death tax’ on everyone to pay for social care, 
regardless of their needs. We want to create 
a system which is based on choice and which 
rewards the hundreds of thousands of people 
who care for an elderly relative full-time. So 
we will allow anyone to protect their home 
from being sold to fund residential care costs 
by paying a one-off insurance premium that is 
entirely voluntary. Independent experts suggest 
this should cost around £8,000. We will support 
older people to live independently at home and 
have access to the personal care they need. We 
will work to design a system where people can 
top up their premium – also voluntarily – to cover 
the costs of receiving care in their own home. </p>

<h4 id="a_healthier_nation">A Healthier Nation</h4>

<p>Lifestyle-linked health problems like obesity 
and smoking, an ageing population, and the 
spread of infectious diseases are leading to 
soaring costs for the nhS. at the same time, 
the difference in male life expectancy between 
the richest and poorest areas in our country is 
now greater than during victorian times. </p>

<p>We will turn the Department of health into 
a Department for Public health so that the 
promotion of good health and prevention of 
illness get the attention they need. We will 
provide separate public health funding to local 
communities, which will be accountable for – 
and paid according to – how successful they
are in improving their residents’ health. in 
addition, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li>introduce a health premium – weighting public 
health funding towards the poorest areas with 
the worst health outcomes; </li>
<li>enable welfare-to-work providers and employers to purchase services from
mental health trusts; and, </li>
<li>increase access to effective ‘talking’ therapies. </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="sweden">Sweden</h5>

<p>Since the free schools programme was established in 
Sweden, over 1,000 new schools have opened. they have 
been founded by foundations, charities and others – and they 
have attracted pupils by offering better discipline and higher 
standards. because any parent can take the money the Swedish 
government spends on their child’s education and choose the 
school they want, standards have risen across the board as 
every school does its best to satisfy parents.</p>

<h3 id="raise_standards_in_schools">Raise Standards in Schools</h3>

<p>We will improve standards for all pupils and close the attainment gap between the richest and 
poorest. We will enhance the prestige and quality of the teaching profession, and give heads and 
teachers tough new powers of discipline. We will restore rigour to the curriculum and exam system 
and give every parent access to a good school. </p>

<p>improving our school system is the most 
important thing we can do to make opportunity 
more equal and address our declining social 
mobility. but britain is slipping down the world 
league tables in reading, maths and Science, 
and violence in the classroom is a serious 
problem. We are falling behind other countries, 
and there is a growing gap between the richest 
and the poorest. We can’t go on like this, for the 
sake of the next generations. </p>

<p>a Conservative government will give many 
more children access to the kind of education 
that is currently only available to the well-off: 
safe classrooms, talented and specialist teachers, 
access to the best curriculum and exams, and 
smaller schools with smaller class sizes with 
teachers who know the children’s names. </p>

<h4 id="better_teachers_and_tougher_discipline">Better Teachers and Tougher Discipline</h4>

<p>the single most important thing for a good 
education is for every child to have access to 
a good teacher. We will take steps to enhance 
the status of the teaching profession and ensure 
it attracts the best people. Schools – especially
struggling ones – must be able to attract the 
best teachers and subject specialists, so we will 
give all head teachers the power to pay good 
teachers more. </p>

<p>We will expand Teach First and introduce 
two new programmes – teach now, for 
people looking to change career, and troops 
to Teachers, for ex-service personnel – to get 
experienced, high-quality people into the 
profession. </p>

<p>We will make it easier for teachers to deal with 
violent incidents and remove disruptive pupils 
or items from the classroom. We believe heads 
are best placed to improve behaviour, which 
is why we will stop them being overruled by 
bureaucrats on exclusions. 
to raise the status of teaching and toughen 
school discipline further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>raise the entry requirement for taxpayer- funded primary school teacher training; </li>
<li><p>expect new graduates to have at least a 2:2 in their degree in order to qualify for
state-funded training;</p></li>
<li><p>pay the student loan repayments for top maths and Science graduates for as long as 
they remain teachers, by redirecting some of 
the current teacher training budget; </p></li>
<li><p>give teachers the strongest possible protection from false accusations; and, </p></li>
<li><p>reinforce powers of discipline by strengthening home-school behaviour 
contracts. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a_rigorous_curriculum_and_exam_system">A rigorous curriculum and  exam system</h4>

<p>every child who is capable of reading should 
be doing so after two years in primary school. 
to make this happen, we will promote the 
teaching of systematic synthetic phonics and 
ensure that teachers are properly trained to 
teach using this method. to provide parents 
with the reassurance they need that their child 
is making progress, we will establish a simple 
reading test at the age of six. </p>

<p>We will reform the national Curriculum so that 
it is more challenging and based on evidence 
about what knowledge can be mastered by 
children at different ages. We will ensure that 
the primary curriculum is organised around 
subjects like maths, Science and history. 
We will encourage setting so those who are 
struggling get extra help and the most able are 
stretched. </p>

<p>Under Labour, the exam system has become 
devalued. We will ensure that our exam system 
is measured against the most rigorous systems 
in the world. We will keep Key Stage 2 tests 
and league tables. We will reform them to 
make them more rigorous. We will make other 
exams more robust by giving universities 
and academics more say over their form and 
content. We want to develop proper vocational 
and technical education that engages young 
people and meets the needs of modern business. 
So we will establish technical academies 
across england, starting in at least twelve cities. </p>

<p>People expect to be able to make choices 
about the services they use, based on robust 
information about the quality on offer. So a 
Conservative government will reform school 
league tables so that schools can demonstrate 
they are stretching the most able and raising the 
attainment of the less able. 
to improve school standards further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>allow all state schools the freedom to offer the same high quality international exams 
that private schools offer – including giving 
every pupil the chance to study separate 
sciences at gCSe; </p></li>
<li><p>create 20,000 additional young apprenticeships; </p></li>
<li><p>allow schools and colleges to offer workplace training;</p></li>
<li><p>publish all performance data currently kept secret by the Department for Children, 
Schools and families; and, </p></li>
<li><p>establish a free online database of exam papers and marking schemes. </p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="give_every_parent_access_to_a_good_school">give every parent access to a good school</h4>

<p>Drawing on the experience of the Swedish 
school reforms and the charter school 
movement in the United States, we will break 
down barriers to entry so that any good 
education provider can set up a new academy 
school. our schools revolution will create a new 
generation of good small schools with smaller 
class sizes and high standards of discipline. </p>

<p>our school reform programme is a major part 
of our anti-poverty strategy, which is why
our first task will be to establish new Academy 
schools in the most deprived areas of the 
country. They will be beacons of excellence
in areas where school standards are 
unacceptably low. </p>

<p>We want every child to benefit from our 
reforms. So all existing schools will have 
the chance to achieve academy status, with 
‘outstanding’ schools pre-approved, and we
will extend the Academy programme to 
primary schools. </p>

<p>education’s real power lies in its ability to 
transform life chances, but we can’t go on 
giving the poorest children the worst education. 
that is why we will introduce a pupil 
premium – extra funding for children from 
disadvantaged backgrounds. </p>

<p>the most vulnerable children deserve the 
very highest quality of care, so we will call a 
moratorium on the ideologically-driven closure 
of special schools. We will end the bias towards 
the inclusion of children with special needs in 
mainstream schools. </p>

<p>People have been far too ready to excuse failure 
in schools. We will ensure that the schools 
inspectorate ofsted adopts a more rigorous 
and targeted inspection regime, reporting on 
performance only in the core areas related to 
teaching and learning. and any school that is 
in special measures for more than a year will 
be taken over immediately by a successful 
academy provider. to give parents better 
access to a good school, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>give parents the power to save local schools threatened by closure, allowing communities 
the chance to take over and run good small 
schools; </p></li>
<li><p>make sure academies have the freedoms that helped to make them so successful in the first 
place; and, </p></li>
<li><p>ensure failing schools are inspected more often – with the best schools visited 
less frequently.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="new_york">New York</h5>

<p>new York shows that it is 
possible to get a grip and cut 
crime. over the past twenty 
years, serious crime in new 
York has fallen by 80 per 
cent, thanks to proactive 
community-based policing 
and the intelligent use of new 
technologies and crime data.</p>

<h3 id="fight_back_against_crime">Fight Back Against Crime</h3>

<p>We will fight back against the crime and anti-social behaviour that blights our communities.
We will take steps to reduce the causes of crime, like poverty and broken families. We will put the 
criminal justice system on the side of responsible citizens, take tougher measures against knife 
criminals and crack down on the binge-drinking that leads to violence. We will cut paperwork to get 
police out on the street and give people democratic control over local policing. We will introduce 
honesty in sentencing and pay voluntary and private providers to reduce re-offending.</p>

<p>recorded violent crime against the person has 
risen sharply under Labour, yet police officers 
spend more time on paperwork than they do out 
on patrol. Labour’s obsession with bureaucratic 
targets and box-ticking is hindering the fight 
against crime. their string of broken promises 
has undermined people’s trust. We can’t go 
on with the police filling in forms instead of 
fighting crime. </p>

<p>a Conservative government will help to mend 
our broken society – by cracking down on 
drink- and drug-fuelled violence, tackling
re-offending, and intervening early to stop 
young people getting onto the conveyor belt
to crime – in order to reduce the causes of
crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>

<p>We will rebuild confidence in the criminal 
justice system so that people know it is on the 
side of victims and working for law-abiding 
people, not criminals. and we will reform the 
police, giving them back their professional 
discretion – getting them out of police stations 
and onto the street, fighting and preventing 
crime – in return for making them truly 
accountable to the people they serve. </p>

<h4 id="targeted_measures_to_reduce_the_causes_of_crime">Targeted Measures to Reduce the Causes of Crime</h4>

<p>Under Labour’s lax licensing regime,
drink-fuelled violence and disorder are a blight 
on many communities. We will overhaul the 
Licensing act to give local authorities and
the police much stronger powers to remove 
licences from, or refuse to grant licences to,
any premises that are causing problems.
in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>allow councils and the police to shut down permanently any shop or bar found 
persistently selling alcohol to children; </li>
<li>double the maximum fine for under-age alcohol sales to £20,000; </li>
<li><p>raise taxes on those drinks linked to anti- social drinking, while abolishing Labour’s 
new ‘cider tax’ on ordinary drinkers; </p></li>
<li><p>ban off-licences and supermarkets from selling alcohol below cost price; and, 
permit local councils to charge more for late- night licences to pay for additional policing. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We recognise the need for criminal sanctions 
like ASBOs and fixed penalty notices, but 
they are blunt instruments that often fail their 
purpose of deterring people from committing 
more crime. We will introduce a series 
of early intervention measures, including 
grounding orders, to allow the police to use 
instant sanctions to deal with anti-social 
behaviour without criminalising young people 
unnecessarily. </p>

<h4 id="put_the_criminal_justice_system_on_the_side_of_the_public">Put the criminal justice system on the side of the public</h4>

<p>Today, almost four out of every five people 
found guilty of a knife crime escape jail. We 
have to send a serious, unambiguous message 
that carrying a knife is totally unacceptable, 
so we will make it clear that anyone convicted 
of a knife crime can expect to face a prison 
sentence. We will introduce mobile knife 
scanners on streets and public transport, and 
extend the length of custodial sentences that 
can be awarded in a magistrates’ Court from 
six to twelve months. </p>

<p>our criminal justice system often lets down 
the victims of crime, so we will ensure that 
victims and their families are better informed 
about the progress of criminal proceedings 
and release of offenders. So that the public 
can be confident their views are accounted 
for in deciding sentences, we will examine 
the case for greater Parliamentary scrutiny 
of sentencing guidelines. We will carry out a 
fundamental review of legal aid to make it work 
more efficiently, and examine ways of bringing 
in alternative sources of funding. </p>

<p>We will change the law so that anyone acting 
reasonably to stop a crime or apprehend a 
criminal is not arrested or prosecuted, and we 
will give householders greater legal protection 
if they have to defend themselves against 
intruders in their homes. </p>

<p>We will implement the Prisoners’ earnings act 
1996 to allow deductions from the earnings 
of prisoners in properly paid work to be paid 
into the victims’ fund. We will use this fund 
to deliver up to fifteen new rape crisis centres 
and give existing rape crisis centres stable, 
long-term funding. To help stop sexual violence 
before it occurs, we will ensure that the school 
curriculum includes teaching young people 
about sexual consent. </p>

<h4 id="reform_the_police">reform the police</h4>

<p>the police should be focusing on police work, 
not paperwork. a Conservative government 
will reduce the amount of paperwork that the 
police have to deal with, starting by scrapping 
the stop form entirely and reducing the burden of stop and search procedures. any search will 
still be recorded but by an officer radioing in, 
rather than filling in paperwork. To allow the 
police to focus on fighting crime, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>amend the health and safety laws that stand in the way of common sense policing; </li>
<li>give police the power to identify offenders in order to protect the public and prevent crime; </li>
<li>return charging discretion to the police for minor offences; and, </li>
<li>process criminals more quickly by video- linking custody cells and courts. </li>
</ul>

<p>Policing relies on consent. People want to
know that the police are listening to them, 
and the police want to be able to focus on 
community priorities, not ticking boxes. 
We will replace the existing, invisible and 
unaccountable police authorities and make 
the police accountable to a directly-elected 
individual who will set policing priorities for 
local communities. they will be responsible 
for setting the budget and the strategy for local 
police forces, with the police retaining their 
operational independence. </p>

<p>giving people democratic control over 
policing priorities is a huge step forward 
in the empowerment of local communities, 
and we will go further by giving people the 
information they need to challenge their 
neighbourhood police teams to cut crime.
We will oblige the police to publish detailed 
local crime data statistics every month, in an 
open and standardised format. </p>

<p>Extremists, serious criminals and others find 
our borders far too easy to penetrate. that is 
why we will create a dedicated border Police 
force, as part of a refocused Serious organised 
Crime agency, to enhance national security, 
improve immigration controls, and crack 
down on the trafficking of people, weapons 
and drugs. We will work with police forces to 
strengthen arrangements to deal with serious 
crime and other cross-boundary policing 
challenges, and extend collaboration between 
forces to deliver better value for money. </p>

<h4 id="prisons_with_a_purpose">Prisons with a purpose</h4>

<p>in the last three years, 80,000 criminals have 
been released early from prison because the 
government failed to build enough places. 
We are determined that early release will not 
be introduced again, so we will redevelop the 
prison estate and increase capacity as necessary 
to stop it. Under Labour, the number of 
foreign criminals in our prisons has more than 
doubled. We will extend early deportation of 
foreign national prisoners to reduce further the 
pressure on our prison population. </p>

<p>many people feel that sentencing in britain 
is dishonest and misleading. So we will 
introduce a system where the courts can 
specify minimum and maximum sentences for certain offenders. these prisoners will only be 
able to leave jail after their minimum sentence 
is served by having earned their release, not 
simply by right. </p>

<p>at the moment, many prisoners leave jail 
and lapse back into a life of drink, drugs and 
re-offending. We will never bring our crime 
rate down or start to reduce the costs of crime 
until we properly rehabilitate ex-prisoners. 
So, with a Conservative government, when 
offenders leave prison, they will be trained and 
rehabilitated by private and voluntary sector 
providers, under supervision. We will use the 
same approach that lies behind our welfare 
reform plans – payment by results – to cut 
re-offending, with organisations paid using 
savings made in the criminal justice system 
from the resulting lower levels of crime. </p>

<p>Drug and alcohol addiction are behind many 
of the crimes that are committed on our 
streets, but the treatment that too many addicts 
receive just maintains their habits. We will 
give courts the power to use abstinence-based 
Drug rehabilitation orders to help offenders 
kick drugs once and for all. We will introduce 
a system of temporary bans on new ‘legal 
highs’ while health issues are considered by 
independent experts. </p>

<p>to reform our system of rehabilitation further, 
we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>apply our payment by results reforms to the youth justice system; </li>
<li>engage with specialist organisations to provide education, mentoring and drug </li>
<li>rehabilitation programmes to help young offenders go straight; and, </li>
<li>pilot a scheme to create Prison and rehabilitation trusts so that just one 
organisation is responsible for helping
to stop a criminal re-offending.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="change_politics">Change politics</h1>

<h2 id="a_new_agenda_for_a_new_politics">A New Agenda for a New Politics</h2>

<p>The Conservative Party has led the way in sorting out the mess of MPs’ expenses. In government 
we will go further, by cutting the size of Parliament, cutting the scope of Whitehall, and cutting
the cost of politics. We will make politics more local, more transparent and more accountable.
We intend to build a new political system that serves people rather than politicians. Together,
we can change our politics for the better. </p>

<p>The events of recent months have revealed the size of the fissures in our political system. 
millions of people in this country are at best detached from democracy, at worst angry and 
disillusioned. this endangers our ability to work together to solve our common problems. just 
putting this down to the shocking revelations of the expenses scandal would be a great mistake. 
MPs’ expenses might have been the trigger for the public’s anger, but this political crisis is driven 
by a deeper sense of frustration – that people have too little control over the decisions that affect 
their daily lives. </p>

<p>The top-down model of power that exists in Britain today is completely out of date. The 
argument that has applied for well over a century – that in every area of life we need people at 
the centre to make sense of the world for us and take decisions on our behalf – has collapsed. We 
now live in an age when technology can put information that was previously held by a few into 
the hands of the many. this is an age of personal freedom and choice, when culture and debate are 
shaped by a multitude of voices. but politics has not caught up with this new age. instead of giving 
people more power over their lives, we have a government intent on taking it away. </p>

<p>We believe in people power – and today the information revolution gives us the practical tools
to realise that philosophy. So we plan to change britain with a sweeping redistribution of power: 
from the state to citizens; from the government to Parliament; from Whitehall to communities; 
from brussels to britain; from bureaucracy to democracy. taking power away from the political 
elite and handing it to the man and woman in the street. Using decentralisation, accountability
and transparency, we will weaken the old political elites, give people power, fix our broken politics 
and restore people’s faith that if we act together things can change. this is a new agenda for
a new politics.</p>

<h5 id="shaun_bailey">Shaun bailey</h5>

<p>“We need a new kind of politics in this 
country, a politics where people join because 
they want to do something, not because they 
want to be someone. We need to reverse the 
relationship between politicians and people 
so that it’s the people demanding respect 
from politicians, not the other way around. 
i’ve spent my career working with and for 
the people of my community, and now i’m 
hoping to be fi ghting for that community in 
Parliament. this manifesto is a call to action 
for all of us to take control and do our bit in 
our communities.” 
Shaun bailey is a youth worker and is the Conservative 
candidate for hammersmith and Shepherd’s bush</p>

<h2 id="make_politics_more_accountable">Make Politics More Accountable</h2>

<p>We will clean up politics: the expenses, the lobbying and problems with party funding. We will cut 
the cost of Parliament, cut the number of MPs and cut Ministers’ pay. We will give citizens direct 
control over what goes on in Westminster, make government more accountable and safeguard the 
independence of the civil service.</p>

<p>it is vital that we act quickly and decisively 
to restore the reputation of politics. too much 
unacceptable behaviour has gone unchecked 
for too long, from excessive expenses to
sleazy lobbying practices. the people of 
britain have looked on in horror as revelations 
have stripped away the dignity of Parliament, 
leaving millions of voters detached from the 
political process, devoid of trust in the political 
classes, and disillusioned with our system
of government. </p>

<p>We will act rapidly to push through far- 
reaching reforms to restore ethics to politics 
and revive the electorate’s faith in politicians.
it will take nothing less than a deep clean of the 
political system in Westminster to root out the 
sleaze and dispel suspicion. We will start by 
cleaning up the expenses system to ensure
mPs live by the same standards as the people 
who give them their jobs, and by curbing the 
way in which former ministers have secured 
lobbying jobs by exploiting their contacts. </p>

<p>but that is just the start. We will also cut 
ministers’ pay and reduce the number of
mPs in Parliament. then we will go further, 
far further, since the expenses scandal was just 
the trigger for a deeper sense of frustration. 
We promise a total overhaul of our system of 
government, so that power is passed from the 
politicians at Westminster back to the people of 
britain. but this is the very least that is needed 
to fix our broken political system. </p>

<h4 id="clean_up_westminster">Clean up Westminster</h4>

<p>the political crisis was triggered by the scandal 
of MPs’ expenses. We were the Party that 
insisted that MPs’ expenses were published 
online, and we have supported the independent 
proposals to clean up the house of Commons. 
We proposed legislation so that anyone 
wanting to be a member of either the house 
of Commons or the house of Lords will need 
to be treated as a full UK taxpayer. But much, 
much more is needed to clean up our politics 
and restore public trust. </p>

<p>at the moment, there is no way that local 
constituents can remove an mP found 
guilty of serious wrongdoing until there is a 
general election. that is why a Conservative 
government will introduce a power of ‘recall’</p>

<p>to allow electors to kick out mPs, a power 
that will be triggered by proven serious 
wrongdoing. and we will introduce
a Parliamentary Privilege act to make clear 
that privilege cannot be abused by mPs to 
evade justice. </p>

<p>the cost of politics has spiralled out of 
control. We will cut the perks and bureaucracy 
associated with Parliament to save over 
£100 million a year. We will consult with 
the independent Parliamentary Standards 
authority on how to move away from the 
generous final-salary pension system for MPs. </p>

<p>The public are concerned about the influence 
of money on politics, whether it is from trade 
unions, individuals, or the lobbying industry. 
We will seek an agreement on a comprehensive 
package of reform that will encourage 
individual donations and include an across- 
the-board cap on donations. this will mark the 
end of the big donor era and the problems it has 
sometimes entailed. </p>

<p>a Conservative government will introduce 
new measures to ensure that the contacts and 
knowledge ministers gain while being paid by 
the public to serve the public are not unfairly 
used for private gain. We will: </p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that ex-Ministers are banned from lobbying government for two years after 
leaving office; </li>
<li>ensure that ex-Ministers have to seek advice on the business posts they take up for ten 
years after leaving office; </li>
<li>rewrite the ministerial Code to make clear that any former minister who breaks the 
rules on appointments will be forced to
give up some or all of their ministerial 
pension; and, </li>
<li>introduce new rules to stop central  government bodies using public money
to hire lobbyists to lobby other
government bodies. </li>
</ul>

<p>the lobbying industry must regulate itself to 
ensure its practices are transparent – if it does 
not, then we will legislate to do so. </p>

<h4 id="give_citizens_more_power">give citizens more power</h4>

<p>People have been shut out of Westminster 
politics for too long. having a single vote every 
four or five years is not good enough – we need 
to give people real control over how they are 
governed. So, with a Conservative government, 
any petition that secures 100,000 signatures 
will be eligible for formal debate in Parliament. 
the petition with the most signatures will 
enable members of the public to table a bill 
eligible to be voted on in Parliament. and we 
will introduce a new Public reading Stage 
for bills to give the public an opportunity to 
comment on proposed legislation online.</p>

<p>Labour have meddled shamelessly with 
the electoral system to try to gain political 
advantage. a Conservative government will 
ensure every vote will have equal value by 
introducing ‘fair vote’ reforms to equalise the 
size of constituency electorates, and conduct a 
boundary review to implement these changes 
within five years. We will swiftly implement 
individual voter registration, giving everyone 
the right to cast their vote in person and making 
it easier for UK citizens living overseas to vote. </p>

<p>We support the first-past-the-post system for 
Westminster elections because it gives voters 
the chance to kick out a government they are 
fed up with. We will work to build a consensus 
for a mainly-elected second chamber to replace 
the current house of Lords, recognising that an 
efficient and effective second chamber should 
play an important role in our democracy and 
requires both legitimacy and public confidence. </p>

<h4 id="make_government_more_accountable_and_representative">make government more accountable and representative</h4>

<p>because we are serious about redistributing 
power, we will restore the balance between the 
government and Parliament, by: </p>

<ul>
<li>establishing a backbench business Committee to give the house of Commons 
more control over its own timetable; </li>
<li>allowing mPs the time to scrutinise law effectively; </li>
<li>providing more free votes, and protecting the principle that issues of conscience – like 
abortion – remain subject to a free vote; and, </li>
<li>making the use of the royal Prerogative subject to greater democratic control so that 
Parliament is properly involved in all big 
national decisions. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will scrap Labour’s failed target regime and 
instead require every department to publish 
a business plan, with senior management 
accountable to more rigorous departmental 
boards for their performance. We will make 
it easier to reward the best civil servants and 
remove the least effective. We will reform the 
Civil Service Compensation Scheme to bring it 
more into line with practice in the private sector. 
We will put a limit on the number of special 
advisers and protect the impartiality of the
civil service. </p>

<p>rebuilding trust in politics means making our 
political system better reflect the people it is 
meant to represent. We will introduce a £1 
million fund to help people with disabilities 
who want to become mPs, councillors or other 
elected officials with the extra costs they face 
in running for office. This will be funded 
from the existing budget of the Government 
Equalities Office.</p>

<h3 id="make_politics_more_transparent">make politics more transparent</h3>

<p>We will publish details of the money government spends and the people it employs. People will 
have a right to government data to make the performance of the state transparent. We will cut the 
unaccountable quango state and root out waste. </p>

<p>Government has been far too profligate for 
far too long. billions are wasted each year on 
pointless bureaucracy and failed projects while 
taxpayers are left to foot the bill. The explosion 
of unaccountable quangos, public sector ‘non- 
jobs’ and costly bureaucracy is an indictment of 
Labour’s reckless approach to spending other 
people’s money. once again, it undermines 
public trust in the political process. </p>

<p>We understand that people want government 
to be more effective in what it does, and to do 
it for less money. that means transforming 
the way the state goes about its business, 
using decentralisation, accountability and 
transparency to reduce dramatically the cost 
of government. and, because sunlight is the 
best disinfectant, we will bring the operation of 
government out into the open so that everyone 
can see whether we are delivering good value 
for money. </p>

<h4 id="publish_data_so_the_public_can_hold_government_to_account">Publish data so the public can hold government to account</h4>

<p>Drawing inspiration from administrations 
around the world which have shown that being 
transparent can transform the effectiveness of 
government, we will create a powerful new 
right to government data, enabling the public to 
request – and receive – government datasets in 
an open and standardised format. independent 
estimates suggest this could provide a £6 
billion boost to the UK economy. We will open 
up Whitehall recruitment by publishing central 
government job vacancies online, saving costs 
and increasing transparency. </p>

<p>a Conservative government will bring in new 
measures to enable the public to scrutinise 
the government’s accounts to see whether it 
is providing value for money. all data will be 
published in an open and standardised format. 
We will: </p>

<ul>
<li>require public bodies to publish online the job titles of every member of staff and the 
salaries and expenses of senior officials paid 
more than the lowest salary permissible 
in Pay band 1 of the Senior Civil Service 
pay scale, and organograms that include all 
positions in those bodies; </li>
<li><p>require anyone paid more than the Prime minister in the public sector to have their 
salary signed off by the treasury;</p></li>
<li><p>require senior civil servants to publish  online details of expense claims and 
meetings with lobbyists; </p></li>
<li>apply these transparency principles to local government, with the threshold for 
publication of spending items and contracts 
set at £500, and for the publication of salaries 
the same as at the national level; and, </li>
<li>give councillors the power to vote on  large salary packages for unelected
council officials. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="curtail_the_quango_state">Curtail the quango state</h4>

<p>Under Labour, the quango state has flourished. 
Government figures show that there are over 
700 unelected bodies spending £46 billion 
every year, but this does not even include the 
range of advisory bodies, public corporations, 
taskforces and regional government bodies that 
have sprung up under Labour. We believe that 
ministers should be responsible for government 
policy, not unelected bureaucrats. any quangos 
that do not perform a technical function or a 
function that requires political impartiality, 
or act independently to establish facts, will be 
abolished. to increase the scrutiny of quangos, 
we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>give Select Committees the right to hold confirmation hearings for major public 
appointments, including the heads
of quangos; </li>
<li>examine the case for giving Select Committees the power to prevent increases 
in quango budgets; and, </li>
<li>ensure that the National Audit Office has full access to the bbC’s accounts. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reduce_the_cost_of_procurement">reduce the cost of procurement</h4>

<p>this government has a dreadful record of 
managing procurement, with billions of pounds 
wasted on mismanaged projects. We will tackle 
wasteful government procurement projects by: </p>

<ul>
<li>strengthening the role of the Chief Information Officer to get a grip on 
government iCt projects; </li>
<li>introducing a series of changes to iCt procurement to deliver better value for money; 
appointing senior private sector non-executives to departmental boards to deliver

<h3 id="make_politics_more_local">Make Politics More Local</h3>

<p>We will put neighbourhoods in charge of planning the way their communities develop, with 
incentives in favour of sustainable development. We will make it easier for everyone to get onto 
the housing ladder. We will give individuals and local government much more power, allow 
communities to take control of vital services, and give people the chance to have a powerful, 
elected mayor in england’s largest cities. </p>

<p>over the last forty years, governments of 
all colours have been guilty of weakening 
local government. but what was a gradual 
centralisation has accelerated dramatically 
under Labour. bureaucratic control has 
replaced democratic accountability. the 
wishes of local people are second-guessed 
by bureaucrats; the activities of councils are 
micro-managed by unelected quangos. this 
hoarding of power by distant politicians and 
unaccountable offi cials in Whitehall has 
damaged society by eroding trust. </p>

<p>We believe that the more responsibility you 
give people, the more responsibly they behave. 
that is why we are so determined to give 
people much more power and control over 
their lives. Citizens themselves should have a 
direct say over how they are governed – but 
not through bureaucratic consultations or 
phoney citizens juries, which never change 
anything. We need a totally different approach 
to governing, one that involves people in 
making the decisions that affect them. this is 
what we call collaborative democracy – people 
taking the kind of powers that until now have 
been exercised only by governments. So 
we want to pass power down to people – to 
individuals where we can. but it is not always 
possible to give power to individuals, and in 
those cases we need to push power down to the 
most appropriate local level: neighbourhood, 
community and local government. </p>

<h4 id="put_communities_in_charge_of_planning">Put communities in charge of planning</h4>

<p>the planning system is vital for a strong 
economy, for an attractive and sustainable 
environment, and for a successful democracy. 
a Conservative government will introduce a 
new ‘open source’ planning system. this will 
mean that people in each neighbourhood will 
be able to specify what kind of development 
they want to see in their area. these 
neighbourhood plans will be consolidated into 
a local plan.</p>

<p>We will abolish the entire bureaucratic and 
undemocratic tier of regional planning, 
including the regional Spatial Strategies and 
building targets. </p>

<p>Developers will have to pay a tariff to the 
local authority to compensate the community 
for loss of amenity and costs of additional 
infrastructure. the tariff will replace the 
payments and levies on development that have 
grown up under Labour. a portion of this tariff 
will be kept by the neighbourhoods in which a 
given development takes place, providing clear 
incentives for communities which go for growth. </p>

<p>Significant local projects, like new housing 
estates, will have to be designed through a 
collaborative process that has involved the 
neighbourhood. immediate neighbours will 
have a new role – with a faster approvals 
process for planning applications where 
neighbours raise no objections. </p>

<p>at the national level, for all forms of 
development, we will publish and present
to Parliament for debate a simple and 
consolidated national planning framework, 
which will set out national economic and 
environmental priorities. </p>

<p>to give communities greater control over 
planning, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>abolish the power of planning inspectors  to rewrite local plans; </li>
<li>amend the ‘Use Classes order’ so that people can use buildings for any purpose allowed in 
the local plan; </li>
<li>limit appeals against local planning decisions to cases that involve abuse of process or 
failure to apply the local plan; </li>
<li>encourage county councils and unitary authorities to compile infrastructure plans; </li>
<li>give local planning authorities and other public authorities a duty to co-operate with 
one another; and, </li>
<li>allow neighbourhoods to stop the practice of ‘garden grabbing’. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="deliver_more_affordable_homes">Deliver more affordable homes</h4>

<p>We want to create a property-owning 
democracy where everyone has the chance 
to own their own home. that is why we will 
permanently raise the stamp duty threshold to 
£250,000 for first-time buyers, meaning nine 
out of ten of them will pay no tax on their first 
home purchase. </p>

<p>Communities should benefit when they choose 
to develop sustainably, so we will match 
pound-for-pound the council tax receipts that 
local authorities receive from new homes to 
encourage sensitive local development. We 
will create new local housing trusts to allow 
communities to grant planning permission 
for new housing within villages and towns – so that the benefits of development remain 
within the local area. We will also abolish 
home information Packs, which have made 
a significant contribution to problems in our 
housing market. 
a Conservative government will make it easier 
for social tenants to own or part-own their 
home. We will: </p>

<ul>
<li>introduce a ‘foot on the ladder’  programme to offer an equity stake to 
good social tenants, which can be cashed 
in when they move out of social rented 
accommodation; </li>
<li>pilot a new ‘right to move’ scheme and  introduce a nationwide social home swap 
programme, so social tenants can transfer
their tenancy to another home or part of the 
country; and, </li>
<li>respect the tenures and rents of social  housing tenants. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will implement a range of measures 
to address the problems of the homeless, 
including introducing more accurate street 
counts and ensuring a minister in each relevant 
department has homelessness in their brief. </p>

<h4 id="give_people_more_power_and_control_over_their_lives">give people more power and control over their lives</h4>

<p>We have set out our plans to give more power 
to people over the way they are policed, the 
schools their children go to and the hospitals 
they are treated in. but, in addition, we want to 
give individuals more direct control over how 
they are governed. So, mirroring our reforms 
at the national level, we will give residents the 
power to instigate local referendums on any 
local issue if 5 per cent of the local population 
sign up, and they will also be able to veto any 
proposed high council tax increases. We will 
stop Labour’s plans to impose supplementary 
business rates on firms if a majority do not give 
their consent. </p>

<p>nothing underlines the powerlessness that 
many communities feel more than the loss 
of essential services, like post offices and 
pubs, because of decisions made by distant 
bureaucrats. our new ‘community right to 
buy’ scheme will give local people the power 
to protect any community assets that are 
threatened with closure. in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>give people a ‘right to bid’ to run any community service instead of the state; and, </li>
<li>reform the governance arrangements  in football to enable co-operative ownership 
models to be established by supporters. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will give democratically accountable local 
government much greater power to improve 
their citizens’ lives by: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>giving local councils a ‘general power of competence’, so that they have explicit 
authority to do what is necessary to improve 
their communities;</p></li>
<li><p>ending ring-fencing so that funding can be spent on local priorities; </p></li>
<li>scrapping the hundreds of process targets Labour have imposed on councils; </li>
<li>ending the bureaucratic inspection regime that stops councils focusing on residents’ 
main concerns; </li>
<li>scrapping Labour’s uncompleted plans to impose unwieldy and expensive unitary 
councils and to force the regionalisation of 
the fire service; </li>
<li>ending the ‘predetermination rules’ that prevent councillors speaking up about
issues that they have campaigned on; and, </li>
<li>encouraging the greater use of ward budgets for councillors. </li>
</ul>

<p>We have seen that a single municipal leader 
can inject dynamism and ambition into their 
communities. So, initially, we will give the 
citizens in each of england’s twelve largest 
cities the chance of having an elected mayor. 
big decisions should be made by those who 
are democratically accountable, not by remote 
and costly quangos. We will abolish the 
Government Office for London as part of our 
plan to devolve more power downwards to the 
London boroughs and the mayor of London. </p>

<p>Decentralising control must go hand in hand 
with creating much greater transparency in 
local government. Power without information 
is not enough. We will implement fully 
the Sustainable Communities act, and 
reintroduce the Sustainable Communities act 
(Amendment) Bill as government legislation, to 
give people greater information on, and control 
over, what is being spent by each government 
agency in their area. </p>

<p>our plans to decentralise power will only
work properly if there is a strong, independent 
and vibrant local media to hold local authorities 
to account. We will sweep away the rules that
stop local newspapers owning other local 
media platforms and create a new network
of local television stations. and we will tighten 
the rules on taxpayer-funded publicity spending 
by town halls.</p>

<h3 id="restore_our_civil_liberties">Restore Our Civil Liberties</h3>

<p>We will scale back Labour’s database state and protect the privacy of the public’s information. 
We will introduce a balanced approach to the retention of people’s dNA and reform the criminal 
records system so it protects children without destroying trust.</p>

<p>Labour have subjected britain’s historic 
freedoms to unprecedented attack. they 
have trampled on liberties and, in their place, 
compiled huge databases to track the activities 
of millions of perfectly innocent people, 
giving public bodies extraordinary powers to 
intervene in the way we live our lives. </p>

<p>the impact of this has been profound and far- 
reaching. trust has been replaced by suspicion. 
the database state is a poor substitute for the 
human judgement essential to the delivery of 
public services. Worse than that, it gives people 
false comfort that an infallible central state is 
looking after their best interests. but the many 
scandals of lost data, leaked documents and 
database failures have put millions at risk. it is 
time for a new approach to protecting our liberty. </p>

<h4 id="protect_our_freedoms">Protect our freedoms</h4>

<p>Labour’s approach to our personal privacy is 
the worst of all worlds – intrusive, ineffective 
and enormously expensive. We will scrap ID 
cards, the national identity register and the 
Contactpoint database. to protect our freedoms 
from state encroachment and encourage 
greater social responsibility, we will replace the 
Human Rights Act with a UK Bill of Rights. 
We will review and reform libel laws to protect 
freedom of speech, reduce costs and discourage 
libel tourism. </p>

<p>Wherever possible, we believe that personal 
data should be controlled by individual citizens 
themselves. We will strengthen the powers 
of the information Commissioner to penalise 
any public body found guilty of mismanaging 
data. We will take further steps to protect 
people from unwarranted intrusion by the state, 
including: </p>

<ul>
<li>cutting back intrusive powers of entry into homes, which have been massively extended 
under Labour; </li>
<li>curtailing the surveillance powers that allow some councils to use anti-terrorism laws to 
spy on people making trivial mistakes or 
minor breaches of the rules; </li>
<li>requiring Privacy impact assessments of any proposal that involves data collection 
or sharing; and, </li>
<li>ensuring proper Parliamentary scrutiny of any new powers of data-sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p>The indefinite retention of innocent people’s 
Dna is unacceptable, yet Dna data provides
a useful tool for solving crimes. We will legislate 
to make sure that our Dna database is used 
primarily to store information about those who 
are guilty of committing crimes rather than
those who are innocent. We will collect the
DNA of all existing prisoners, those under 
state supervision who have been convicted of 
an offence, and anyone convicted of a serious 
recordable offence. We pushed the government 
to end the permanent retention of innocent 
people’s Dna, and we will change the guidance 
to give people on the database who have been 
wrongly accused of a minor crime an automatic 
right to have their Dna withdrawn. </p>

<p>We believe that people working in positions
of trust with children should go through a
proper criminal record check. but Labour’s
new system goes too far. So we will review
the criminal records and ‘vetting and barring’
regime and scale it back to common sense levels. </p>

<p>the hunting act has proved unworkable.
a Conservative government will give Parliament 
the opportunity to repeal the hunting act
on a free vote, with a government bill in 
government time.</p>

<h2 id="strengthen_the_union">Strengthen the Union</h2>

<p>We are a unionist party and we will not put the Union at risk. But we support devolution and are 
committed to making it work for all countries. We will take forward the proposals of the Calman 
Commission, grant a referendum on greater powers for the Welsh Assembly, and support the 
devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. We will rebalance the unfairness in the voting system
for devolved issues in Parliament. </p>

<p>in recent years, we have been hearing things 
that we have not heard for a long time: people 
in Scotland saying they want to leave the UK, 
and some people responding with ‘let them 
go’. Labour’s constitutional vandalism has 
weakened Parliament, undermined democracy 
and brought the integrity of the ballot into 
question. our unbalanced devolution settlement 
has caused separatism to gather momentum in 
Scotland, and separatists have propped up
a weakened Labour Party in Wales. </p>

<p>the Conservative Party is passionate about the 
Union and we will never do anything to put it 
at risk. and, because of the new political force 
we have created with the Ulster Unionists, we 
are proud that at the next election we will be the 
only party fielding candidates in every part of 
the UK. </p>

<h4 id="support_devolution">Support devolution</h4>

<p>We support the changes proposed by 
the Calman Commission for clarifying 
the devolution settlement and creating a 
relationship of mutual respect between 
Westminster and holyrood: </p>

<ul>
<li>the Prime minister and other ministers  will go to holyrood for questioning on
a regular basis. </li>
<li>the Scottish Parliament should have more responsibility for raising the money it spends. 
We will produce our own White Paper by 
may 2011 to set out how we will deal with 
the issues raised by Calman, and we will 
legislate to implement those proposals
within the next Parliament. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will not stand in the way of the referendum 
on further legislative powers requested by 
the Welsh assembly. the people of Wales 
will decide the outcome and Conservatives 
will have a free vote. but our priority 
remains getting people back into work and 
strengthening the Welsh economy. So we will 
seek ways to work with the Welsh assembly 
government to increase economic growth and 
improve people’s quality of life. </p>

<p>in northern ireland, we strongly support 
the political institutions established over the 
past decade and we are committed to making</p>

<p>devolution work. We will continue to promote 
peace, stability and economic prosperity 
and work to bring northern ireland back 
into the mainstream of UK politics. We will 
produce a government paper examining the 
mechanism for changing the corporation tax 
rate in northern ireland, in order to attract 
significant new investment. And we will stop 
the practice of ‘double-jobbing’, whereby 
elected representatives sit in both Westminster 
and Stormont. </p>

<p>Labour have refused to address the so-called 
‘West Lothian Question’: the unfair situation
of Scottish mPs voting on matters which
are devolved. a Conservative government will 
introduce new rules so that legislation referring 
specifically to England, or to England and 
Wales, cannot be enacted without the consent 
of mPs representing constituencies of those 
countries.</p>

<h5 id="strangford_lough_county_down">Strangford Lough, County Down</h5>

<p>farming is at the heart of the rural economy, and a 
signifi cant cultural infl uence in British life. Over half 
a million people are employed in the farming industry, 
which makes use of three quarters of the UK’s land area 
and generates over £4 billion of economic income for the 
UK each year. Organic farming has become increasingly 
important in recent years, with over 5,000 organic farms 
now occupying 700,000 hectares of land. in northern 
ireland, farming’s share of employment and economic 
activity is larger than in any other part of the UK.</p>

<h1 id="protect_the_environment">Protect the environment</h1>

<h3 id="vote_blue_go_green">Vote Blue, Go Green</h3>

<p>A Conservative government will cut carbon emissions and rebuild our energy security. We will 
make it easier for people to go green, with incentives for people to do the right thing. We will 
protect our precious habitats and natural resources, and promote a sustainable farming industry. 
We will fulfil our responsibility to hand on a richer and more sustainable natural environment
to future generations. </p>

<p>We have a vision of a greener britain. it is a country that leads the world in the market for green 
goods and services. a new hi-tech manufacturing sector and a new green investment bank help 
create new jobs, wealth and growth. our cars run on electricity and high speed trains take us across 
the country in less time than it takes to get across the capital. this is a country which has become 
the world’s first low carbon economy. </p>

<p>in this vision, our homes require less energy and more of the energy we produce comes from 
renewable sources. our countryside is better cared for, we conserve more natural habitats, and
we create new green spaces and plant many more trees. our landscape is protected and our wildlife 
is enjoyed by more people of all ages. it is a greener and more pleasant land for all its citizens. 
this is a Conservative vision for our future, and it is based on Conservative values. We believe 
that it is our responsibility to create a clean and healthy environment to pass on to our children. 
that is why we have put green issues back at the heart of our politics and that is why they will be
at the heart of our government. </p>

<p>instead of using rules and regulations to impose a centralised worldview, we will go with the 
grain of human nature, creating new incentives and market signals which reward people for doing 
the right thing. instead of pulling bureaucratic levers from above telling people what they can’t do, 
we will provide people with the information they need to make more responsible choices. instead 
of holding businesses back by imposing unfair retrospective stealth taxes, we will unleash the 
power of green enterprise and promote resource efficiency to generate thousands of green jobs. 
this is how we will live up to our responsibility to be the greenest government in our history.</p>

<h5 id="freiburg">Freiburg</h5>

<p>freiburg in germany is a world leader in 
environmental sustainability. Solar panels have 
been installed across the city – on schools, 
churches and private houses, and even on the 
sports stadium and the City hall. over the past 
30 years, 500km of bike lanes and 9,000 bike 
parking sites have been put in place and, as a 
result, freiburg now has the lowest car usage 
of any city in germany. freiburg also has one 
of the highest recycling rates of any city in the 
world, which has been achieved by changing 
social norms and providing facilities that make 
it as easy as possible for people to recycle. 
this emphasis on sustainability has had an 
economic benefi t too: Freiburg is home to 1,500 
green technology companies, which employ 
over 10,000 people and generate hundreds of 
millions of euros for the local economy.</p>

<h3 id="combat_climate_change">Combat climate change</h3>

<p>We will reduce carbon emissions in line with our international commitments. We will promote 
small- and large-scale low carbon energy production, including nuclear, wind, clean coal and 
biogas. We will safeguard our energy security by ensuring there is sufficient spare capacity in 
the energy system. We will make it easier to go green, including through a ‘green deal’ to cut 
household energy bills. </p>

<p>Labour’s failure on climate change has been 
stark. Strong rhetoric has not been matched 
by effective action – it took the longest and 
deepest recession for sixty years for Labour to 
achieve any significant reduction in the UK’s 
carbon emissions. We need to generate 15 per 
cent of our energy from renewables by 2020, 
but we have one of the worst records of any eU 
nation when it comes to renewable energy. our 
national security is threatened by a looming 
energy crunch in which a third of our electricity 
generating capacity will close, and most of our 
gas will need to be imported by 2020. </p>

<p>Yet britain is uniquely placed to be the world’s 
first low carbon economy: we have the natural 
resources to generate wind and wave power, 
a skilled workforce trained in the energy 
industry, a hi-tech manufacturing sector and a 
green financial centre in the City of London. 
We urgently need to make this transition 
in order to strengthen our economy, help 
guarantee our energy security and protect our 
environment for future generations. </p>

<h4 id="ambitious_goals_for_reducing_emissions">ambitious goals for reducing  emissions</h4>

<p>Climate change is a global phenomenon, and 
that means the world must work together to 
reduce harmful emissions. a Conservative 
government will work towards an ambitious 
global deal that will limit emissions and make 
available substantial financial resources for 
adaptation and mitigation. </p>

<p>as part of our commitment to move towards 
a low carbon future, we can confirm our aim 
of reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent 
by 2050. in government, we will lead from the 
front by delivering a 10 per cent cut in central 
government emissions within twelve months 
and by working with local authorities and 
others to deliver emissions reductions.</p>

<h4 id="promote_low_carbon_energy_production">Promote low carbon energy production</h4>

<p>the way our energy is produced and 
transmitted is stuck in the last century. a 
Conservative government will transform this 
‘dumb’, unresponsive network and create an 
‘electricity internet’ – a highly interactive 
network, based on a new smart grid that will 
interact with smart meters in people’s homes, 
to manage supply and demand. this will allow 
a huge increase in renewable power, and far 
greater choice for consumers. </p>

<p>To limit harmful emissions from UK power 
stations, we will take steps to encourage new 
low carbon energy production, including: </p>

<ul>
<li>introducing an emissions Performance Standard to limit the levels of greenhouse 
gases our power stations produce; </li>
<li>clearing the way for new nuclear power stations – provided they receive no public 
subsidy; </li>
<li>creating four carbon capture and storage- equipped plants, taking coal – one of the 
most polluting fuels of all – and transforming 
it into a low carbon fuel of the future; </li>
<li>delivering an offshore electricity grid in order to support the development of a
new generation of offshore wind power,
and establishing at least two marine
energy Parks; </li>
<li>giving local authorities the power to establish new district heating networks which use 
biogas and other low carbon fuels; </li>
<li>allowing communities that host renewable energy projects like wind farms to keep the 
additional business rates they generate for six 
years; and, </li>
<li>giving incentives for smaller-scale energy generation, including capturing heat that is 
currently wasted. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="safeguard_the_uks_energy_security">Safeguard the UK’s energy security</h4>

<p>britain has had no clear energy policy for 
thirteen years. a succession of eleven energy 
ministers and eight Secretaries of State with 
responsibility for energy has left our policy 
muddled and put our energy security at 
risk. britain needs an energy policy that is 
clear, consistent and stable. that means that 
ministers will be unambiguously responsible 
for determining energy policy and delivering 
an annual energy Statement to Parliament 
to set a clear direction for energy policy. to 
safeguard our energy security, we will reform 
the energy regulator ofgem so that: </p>

<ul>
<li>it focuses on executing energy policy; </li>
<li>it is tasked with monitoring the spare capacity in the energy market and making 
provisions for additional capacity where 
required; and,</li>
<li>its competition policy and consumer protection powers pass to the Office of
fair trading. </li>
</ul>

<p>as a result, we will cut the number of quangos 
intervening in the energy market. </p>

<p>Labour’s just-in-time approach to energy 
supply has left us badly exposed to events 
outside our control. We will work to diversify 
the sources of the gas we need, secure long- 
term contracts and increase storage capacity to 
guarantee supplies throughout the year. </p>

<h4 id="help_people_go_green">Help People Go Green</h4>

<p>rising energy costs hit families hard, so we 
will create a ‘green Deal’, giving every home 
up to £6,500 worth of energy improvement 
measures – with more for hard-to-treat homes 
– paid for out of savings made on fuel bills over 
25 years. </p>

<p>We will increase consumers’ control over
their energy costs by ensuring that every 
energy bill provides information on how to 
move to the cheapest tariff offered by their 
supplier and how their energy usage compares 
to similar households. </p>

<p>We will improve the energy efficiency
of everyday appliances by drawing on
the experience of the ‘top runner’ scheme
from japan. </p>

<p>to help further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>ensure that 10 per cent of the staff directly employed by ‘green Deal’ providers are 
apprentices, helping to build a green collar 
workforce for the future; </li>
<li>keep Energy Performance Certificates to help people improve the environmental rating of 
their property; and, </li>
<li>give Post Office Card Account holders the chance to benefit from direct debit discounts, 
worth up to £150 a year.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conserve_and_enhance_the_natural_environment">Conserve and enhance the natural environment</h3>

<p>We will protect and improve the Uk’s natural environment, and pioneer new schemes to improve 
conservation. We will push for reform of the Common Agricultural and Fisheries Policies to 
promote sustainable farming and fi shing. We will promote high animal welfare standards and 
ensure that government procures locally-produced food wherever possible. We will work towards 
a zero-waste society.</p>

<p>Conservatives understand the inherent value 
of conserving things, and we know the 
importance of ensuring that we provide a 
good quality of life for future generations. our 
natural environment has been degraded and 
urgent action is needed to address the loss of 
vital ecosystems in the face of climate change 
and development. Labour have relied too much 
on regulation and top-down targets that have 
failed to halt biodiversity loss. </p>

<p>We need to act now to enhance biodiversity, 
protect our countryside and marine 
environment, and secure the vital eco-systems 
that sustain life on land, in our rivers and in 
our seas. a Conservative government will take 
a broad approach to improving the natural 
environment as a whole, so that we can ensure 
a secure future for the natural world where vital 
ecological assets are protected and resources 
are used more responsibly. </p>

<h4 id="conserve_wildlife">Conserve wildlife</h4>

<p>Too many animals remain at risk of extinction, 
and climate change will put even more pressure 
on endangered species and precious habitats. 
We will support the strongest protection for 
endangered species and work to protect vital 
habitats from destruction. We will tackle the 
smuggling and illegal trade in wildlife through 
our new border Police force. </p>

<p>We will fight for wholesale reform of the 
Common fisheries Policy to encourage 
sustainable practices, give communities a 
greater say over the future of their fi shing 
industries, and bring an end to the scandal 
of fi sh discards. We will take forward the 
marine and Coastal access act and ensure that 
its conservation measures are implemented 
effectively, including the creation of marine 
Conservation Zones. </p>

<p>We will be equally vigilant in ensuring the 
welfare of animals. We will promote the 
highest standards of farm animal welfare. 
We will work to reduce the use of animals in 
scientifi c research. We will promote responsible 
pet ownership by introducing effective codes 
of practice under the animal Welfare act, and 
target irresponsible owners of dangerous dogs.</p>

<p>to give wildlife greater protection, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>firmly oppose any resumption of commercial whaling and do all we can to ensure that the 
international moratorium stays in place; </li>
<li>press for a total ban on ivory sales and the destruction of existing stockpiles; and, </li>
<li>promote new green spaces and wildlife corridors to help animals adapt and thrive
in the face of climate change. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="protect_habitats">Protect habitats</h4>

<p>the natural world faces great pressure from 
development and climate change. We will 
produce a White Paper on protecting the 
natural environment, including a focus on 
restoring habitat. We will pioneer a new system 
of conservation credits to protect habitats. </p>

<p>We will maintain national green belt 
protection, areas of outstanding natural 
Beauty (AONBs), National Parks, Sites 
of Special Scientific Interest and other 
environmental designations which protect
the character of our country’s landscape.
in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>review the governance arrangements for national Parks and aonbs to ensure 
that they are more accountable to local 
communities; and, </li>
<li>work to reduce litter, which spoils too much  of our countryside and urban environment. </li>
</ul>

<p>Since 1997, the area of new woodland created 
in england each year has more than halved. 
in addition to ongoing woodland creation, we 
will launch a national tree planting campaign, 
planting up to one million new trees in the next 
Parliament. We will tackle illegal logging by: </p>

<ul>
<li>pressing for financial support from within a reformed eU budget to be given to 
developing countries to halt deforestation; </li>
<li>pressing for only legally-harvested timber and timber products to be made available
on the market; and, </li>
<li>introducing a new criminal offence under UK law for the import and possession of 
illegal timber. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="promote_sustainable_and">Promote sustainable and</h4>

<p>productive farming practices 
our farmland is a national resource for future 
generations and the foundation of our food 
security. We will prevent development on the 
most fertile farmland, in all but exceptional 
circumstances. to promote sustainable farming 
practices further, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>support the Campaign for the farmed environment and seek to create a more 
effective system of environmental 
stewardship; </li>
<li><p>ensure that consumers have the right to choose non-gm foods through clear labelling;</p></li>
<li><p>not permit any commercial planting of gm
crops until and unless it has been assessed as 
safe for people and the environment; and, </p></li>
<li>develop a legally-binding protocol covering the separation of gm and non-gm material, 
including clear industry liability. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will negotiate for further reform of the 
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to deliver 
greater value for money while supporting the 
sustainability of british farming. the new CaP 
should reflect the importance we attach to the 
environment, to ensuring food security and 
to tackling global poverty. We advocate the 
dismantling of market-distorting subsidies at 
a pace that allows time for british farmers and 
producers in developing countries to adapt. We 
will minimise and reform on-farm inspections, 
and abolish the agricultural Wages board. </p>

<p>the most pressing animal health problem in the 
UK today is bovine tuberculosis (bTB), which 
has led to the slaughter of over 250,000 cattle 
since 1997. as part of a package of measures, 
we will introduce a carefully-managed and 
science-led policy of badger control in areas 
with high and persistent levels of btb. </p>

<p>government should take the lead by procuring 
more sustainably. We will ensure that food 
procured by government departments, and 
eventually the whole public sector, meets british 
standards of production, wherever this can be 
achieved without increasing overall costs. </p>

<p>We will introduce honesty in food labelling, if 
necessary through legislation, so consumers 
can be confident about where their food comes 
from. this will ensure that meat labelled as 
‘british’ is born and bred in britain, and raised 
to our high welfare standards. and we will 
promote local food networks so that homes 
and businesses can obtain supplies of locally- 
produced food. </p>

<p>We will ensure a fair market for food suppliers 
– especially farmers – by reducing the 
burden of regulation. to ensure the grocery 
supply code of practice is applied fairly, we 
will introduce an independent supermarket 
ombudsman. </p>

<h4 id="use_natural_resources_responsibly">Use natural resources responsibly</h4>

<p>We will introduce a responsibility Deal on 
waste – a voluntary arrangement among 
producers to cut back on the production of 
waste and improve its disposal – as we move 
towards our goal of a zero-waste society. </p>

<p>households need new incentives to go green, 
so we will reward people who do the right 
thing by encouraging councils to pay people 
to recycle, while scrapping Labour’s plans for 
new bin taxes on families. To help this happen, 
we will put a floor under the standard rate of 
landfill tax until 2020 to encourage alternative 
forms of waste disposal.</p>

<p>With a rising population and growing strains 
on our water supply, industry and customers 
alike need new incentives to conserve water. 
We will reform the water industry, and bring 
in new measures to encourage businesses and 
households to value this precious resource
more highly, and protect poorer households 
from excessive rises in water bills. </p>

<p>To cope with the increased risk of flooding 
associated with climate change, we will 
take forward the findings of the Pitt Review 
to improve our flood defences, prevent 
unnecessary building in areas of high flood 
risk, and ensure the country is better
equipped when flooding does take place.</p>

<h5 id="manchester">manchester</h5>

<p>manchester was the epicentre of the 
industrial revolution, and the fi rst 
industrialised city in the world. today, the 
city is a national symbol of successful urban 
regeneration. over the past three decades, 
Manchester has undergone extensive urban 
renewal, transforming the city’s canals, 
mills and warehouses into vibrant new 
commercial, residential, and cultural spaces 
– including the creation of the imperial 
War Museum North (pictured). As a result 
of this regeneration, manchester is one of 
britain’s most dynamic cities, and has been 
voted amongst the best places in the country 
to locate a business.</p>

<h1 id="promote_our_national_interest">Promote our national interest</h1>

<p>a stronger britain in a safer world 
A Conservative government will defend our national security and support our brave Armed 
Forces in everything they do. We will promote our national interest with an active foreign policy. 
We will work constructively with the EU, but we will not hand over any more areas of power and 
we will never join the Euro. We will honour our aid commitments and make sure this money works 
for the poorest nations. </p>

<p>this country possesses great assets and advantages – a permanent seat on the Un Security 
Council, a leading role in nato, a strong relationship with the United States, a major role in the 
affairs of the eU, and armed forces that are the envy of the world. We are a global trading nation 
and home to the world’s pre-eminent language. </p>

<p>but, looking a decade or two ahead, powerful forces of economics and demography elsewhere 
in the world will make it harder for us to maintain our influence. All this in a world that is 
becoming more dangerous, where threats as diverse as state failure, international terrorism and 
new forms of warfare are being amplified by the impact of climate change and the spread of nuclear 
weapons technology. In a world of shifting economic power and increased threats, the UK stands 
to lose a great deal of its ability to shape world affairs unless we act to reverse our declining status. </p>

<p>We no longer inhabit a world in which foreign and defence issues can be separated from 
domestically-generated threats. instead, we live in a world in which dangers, events and actions 
abroad are inter-dependent with threats to our security at home. We must meet the threats we face 
with a concerted response from the state. that response cannot just come from how we conduct our 
foreign affairs, or organise our defence and internal security – it must cut across energy, education, 
community cohesion, health, technology, international development and the environment too.</p>

<h1 id="defend_our_security">Defend our security</h1><p>We will create a National Security Council to oversee all aspects of our security, chaired by the 
Prime Minister. We are committed to succeeding in our mission in Afghanistan and will not leave 
our Forces without the resources they need to fulfi l this goal. We will repair the Military Covenant 
with a series of measures to support service personnel, their families and veterans.</p>

<p>Labour have failed to deliver a unifi ed and 
coherent approach to national security. 
they have not even kept their promise of a 
comprehensive national Security budget. 
their incompetence places our nation at risk. 
Despite fi ghting two major wars in the last 
decade, Labour have cut the target for the 
trained strength of the army, shrunk the size 
of the Navy by a fi fth and run down the RAF. </p>

<p>the men and women of our armed forces 
are the ones charged with protecting our 
nation’s security. but Labour’s dangerous 
mismanagement has endangered lives and 
harmed britain’s capacity to defend itself. 
Labour have been too slow to provide the 
equipment, such as helicopters, which our 
forces on operations have badly needed. our 
brave men and women, their families, and our 
veterans deserve the best for putting their lives 
on the line to protect our liberties. We will 
ensure they get the best. </p>

<h3 id="a_resilient_nation">a resilient nation</h3>

<p>We understand the severity of the threats that 
exist and will do all we can to make Britain 
safe. We will establish a national Security 
Council to co-ordinate responses to the dangers 
we face, which will be chaired by the Prime 
minister. in addition, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>create a national Security adviser and a new national resilience team for homeland 
Security; </li>
<li>develop a national Security Strategy and oversee a Strategic Defence and Security 
review that implements that strategy; and, </li>
<li>establish a new Permanent military Command for homeland Defence and 
Security to provide a more structured 
military contribution to homeland security. </li>
</ul>

<p>terrorism remains a major threat to our 
country and some of the biggest threats to our 
security do not come from abroad – they are 
home grown. a Conservative government will 
ban any organisations which advocate hate or 
the violent overthrow of our society, such as 
hizb-ut-tahrir, and close down organisations 
which attempt to fund terrorism from the UK. 
in northern ireland, we will continue to give 
our fullest support to the police and other</p>

<p>agencies in their efforts to combat the threat 
from dissident republican and other terrorist 
organisations. </p>

<h3 id="support_our_brave_armed_forces">Support our brave armed forces</h3>

<p>our mission in afghanistan is vital to our 
national security. Success in afghanistan will 
be achieved when it is a more stable state, 
able to manage its own security, resist outside 
interference, and prevent terrorists from using 
its territory as a safe haven. We will always 
ensure our forces have the resources they need 
to carry out their mission properly, and we will 
press other members of nato to take their fair 
share of the military burden. the training of 
afghanistan’s own security forces is key to the 
success of the mission, and we will continue to 
make it a priority. </p>

<p>our Strategic Defence and Security review 
will ensure that resources for our armed forces 
are matched to our foreign policy requirements. 
We support the decision to renew britain’s 
submarine-based nuclear deterrent, based on 
the trident missile system. </p>

<p>the hopeless mismanagement of defence 
procurement by this government has wasted 
billions of taxpayers’ money and left our 
armed forces underequipped and dangerously 
exposed. We will review the structure of the 
ministry of Defence to reduce running costs by 
25 per cent. We will reform the procurement 
process to ensure the delivery of equipment on 
time and on budget. We will release spending 
on unnecessary and bureaucratic eU defence 
initiatives and spend the money on our armed 
forces. as part of that process, we will 
re-evaluate our position with the european 
Defence agency. </p>

<p>our commitment to look after the armed 
forces and their families – the military 
Covenant – has been allowed to fall into 
disrepair. this is one of the most damning 
failures of gordon brown’s government. We 
will restore the military Covenant and ensure 
that our armed forces, their families and 
veterans are properly taken care of. to make 
that happen, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>double the operational allowance; </li>
<li>maximise rest and recuperation leave; </li>
<li>ensure our servicemen and women are 
treated in dedicated military wards in 
hospital; </li>
<li>change the rules so that service personnel are 
not locked out of the voting system by rules 
that Labour have introduced; </li>
<li><p>use ‘pupil level annual school census’ data to 
include service children within our plans for 
a pupil premium in schools, ensuring they 
attract extra funding;</p></li>
<li><p>provide university and further education scholarships for the children of servicemen 
and women killed while on active duty, 
backdated to 1990; 
pilot a mental health follow-up service for those who have left the services; and, </p></li>
<li>review the rules governing the awarding  of medals.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="iran">Iran</h5>

<p>in iran, hundreds of thousands of citizens calling for democratic reforms are using new 
technologies to come together, coordinate their protests against the state, and communicate 
with the outside world. The power of these information fl ows is growing rapidly. Every time 
the Iranian state has tried to choke the fl ow of information to dampen down the protests, people 
have turned to new technologies to share and access information. When the state cut off text 
messaging services, protesters switched to social media like twitter and facebook. When foreign 
journalists had their visas removed and had to leave the country, iranians began to upload video 
clips onto Youtube so that the government’s actions could continue to be scrutinised. and when 
the government tried to ban popular websites, private citizens outside Iran set up proxy internet 
servers so that iranians could continue to access information.</p>

<h1 id="a_liberal_conservative_foreign_policy">A Liberal Conservative Foreign Policy</h1>

<p>We have great national assets and advantages to help us make the most of the opportunities we 
face and to deal with challenges. We will engage positively with the world to deepen alliances and 
build new partnerships. We will help reform international institutions, help those in need, and play 
our part in tackling climate change and the proliferation of military nuclear technology.</p>

<p>a Conservative government’s approach 
to foreign affairs will be based on liberal 
Conservative principles. Liberal, because 
britain must be open and engaged with 
the world, supporting human rights and 
championing the cause of democracy and 
the rule of law at every opportunity. but 
Conservative, because our policy must be
hard-headed and practical, dealing with the 
world as it is and not as we wish it were. </p>

<p>our approach to foreign affairs is based on a 
belief in freedom, human rights and democracy. 
We are sceptical about grand utopian schemes to 
remake the world. We will work patiently with 
the grain of other societies, but we will always 
support liberal values because they provide the 
foundations for stability and prosperity. </p>

<p>Protecting britain’s enlightened national 
interest requires global engagement. We will 
be safer if our values are strongly upheld and 
widely respected in the world. our national 
identity is bound up in our historic global 
role as an outward-looking nation, giving 
generously to developing countries, and 
providing a safe haven to genuine refugees.</p>

<p>it is not in our character to have a foreign policy 
without a conscience or to turn our back on the 
millions who live in poverty and conflict. </p>

<h3 id="promote_our_enlightened_national_interest">Promote our enlightened national interest</h3>

<p>a Conservative government will champion 
a distinctive british foreign policy. We will 
renew and reinforce our engagement with the 
rest of the world and build up British influence 
by deepening our alliances beyond europe and 
the United States, not only diplomatically but in 
culture, education, commerce and security. </p>

<p>a Conservative government will always speak 
up for freedom and human rights. torture is 
unacceptable and abhorrent, and we will never 
condone it. </p>

<p>We will support humanitarian intervention 
when it is practical and necessary, while 
working with other countries to prevent conflict 
arising. </p>

<p>Promoting britain’s interests and values means 
developing and strengthening our alliances and reforming international institutions. to achieve 
these goals, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>work to establish a new special relationship with india, the world’s largest democracy; </li>
<li>seek closer engagement with China while standing firm on human rights; </li>
<li>elevate our relationships with many friendly nations, including in the middle east, as 
well as north africa, South asia and Latin 
america; </li>
<li>press to keep the eU’s doors open to those countries, including turkey, that wish to join, 
conditional on the rigorous application of the 
accession criteria; </li>
<li>support permanent seats on the United nations Security Council for japan, india, 
germany, brazil and african representation; 
and, </li>
<li>strengthen the Commonwealth as a focus for promoting democratic values and 
development. </li>
</ul>

<p>We will work with our allies across the world 
to prevent conflict and secure peace. We will 
maintain a strong, close and frank relationship 
with the United States. We will work closely 
with other european countries to establish a 
common approach to common problems, such 
as climate change. We will be committed to 
nato as the ultimate guarantor of europe’s 
security. to ensure our global security further, 
we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>work towards greater stability in afghanistan and Pakistan; </li>
<li>support concerted international efforts to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear 
weapon; </li>
<li>support a two-state solution to the middle east Peace Process; </li>
<li>promote stability in the Western balkans; </li>
<li>always be ready to assist Cypriots in their efforts to agree a just, balanced and lasting 
settlement to reunite their island; and, </li>
<li>play our part in efforts to make the world safer from the dangers of nuclear weapons 
and nuclear proliferation.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="an_open_and_democratic_europe">An Open and Democratic Europe</h1>

<p>We will be positive members of the European Union but we are clear that there should be no 
further extension of the EU’s power over the Uk without the British people’s consent. We will 
ensure that by law no future government can hand over areas of power to the EU or join the 
Euro without a referendum of the British people. We will work to bring back key powers over 
legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the Uk. </p>

<p>the european Union has done much to 
reconcile the painful division of europe and to 
spread democracy and the rule of law across 
our continent. but it should not rest on those 
achievements. </p>

<p>european countries need to work together to 
boost global economic growth, fi ght global 
poverty, and combat global climate change. 
the european Union has a crucial part to play 
in enabling the countries of europe to meet 
these great challenges of the 21st century. a 
Conservative government will play an active 
and energetic role in the european Union to 
advance these causes. </p>

<p>We will stand for open markets, and a strong 
transatlantic relationship; for an eU that looks 
out to the world, and that builds strong and 
open relations with rising powers like China 
and india. and, like every other member State, 
we will fi ght our corner to promote our 
national interests. </p>

<p>We believe britain’s interests are best served 
by membership of a european Union that is an 
association of its member States. We will never 
allow britain to slide into a federal europe. 
Labour’s ratifi cation of the Lisbon Treaty 
without the consent of the british people has 
been a betrayal of this country’s democratic 
traditions. in government, we will put in place 
a number of measures to make sure this 
shameful episode can never happen again. </p>

<h3 id="restore_democratic_control">restore democratic control</h3>

<p>in future, the british people must have their 
say on any transfer of powers to the european 
Union. We will amend the 1972 european 
Communities act so that any proposed future 
treaty that transferred areas of power, or 
competences, would be subject to a referendum 
– a ‘referendum lock’. a Conservative 
government would never take the UK into 
the euro. our amendment to the 1972 act will 
prevent any future government from doing 
so without a referendum.</p>

<p>Unlike other European countries, the UK 
does not have a written constitution. We will 
introduce a United Kingdom Sovereignty Bill 
to make it clear that ultimate authority stays in 
this country, in our Parliament. </p>

<p>the Lisbon treaty contains a number of so- 
called ‘ratchet clauses’, which allow the powers 
of the EU to expand in the future without a 
new treaty. We do not believe that any of 
these ‘ratchet clauses’ should be used to hand 
over more powers from britain to the eU. So 
a Conservative government will not agree to 
the UK’s participation in the establishment of a 
European Public Prosecutor’s Office or permit 
its jurisdiction over the UK. We will change the 
1972 act so that an act of Parliament would be 
required before any ‘ratchet clause’ could be 
used. additionally, the use of a major ‘ratchet 
clause’ which amounted to the transfer of an 
area of power to the eU would be subject to a 
referendum. </p>

<p>the steady and unaccountable intrusion of 
the european Union into almost every aspect 
of our lives has gone too far. a Conservative 
government will negotiate for three specific 
guarantees – on the Charter of fundamental 
rights, on criminal justice, and on social and 
employment legislation – with our european 
partners to return powers that we believe 
should reside with the UK, not the EU. We 
seek a mandate to negotiate the return of these 
powers from the EU to the UK.</p>

<h5 id="project_umubano">Project Umubano</h5>

<p>every summer for the past three years, the Conservative Party has been running 
‘Project Umubano’ in rwanda. over that period, Conservative mPs and volunteers 
have provided english lessons to 3,000 rwandan primary school teachers, 
renovated a school, established a small medical library at Kirambi Health Centre, 
and built a community centre. Project Umubano is a sign of our commitment to one 
World Conservatism, and our belief in the positive power of social action. 
robert halfon, pictured, is the Conservative candidate for harlow</p>

<h1 id="one_world_conservatism">One World Conservatism</h1>

<p>We will honour our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income in aid, and ensure our 
aid is transparent and properly targeted. We will spend at least £500 million a year to tackle 
malaria. Both the British people and those who receive aid will get more control over how it is 
spent. We will push for a trade deal which brings growth to the poorest countries, helps those 
countries adapt to climate change, and puts in place the building blocks of wealth creation. </p>

<p>the global downturn has shaken up rich and 
poor countries alike. for poor countries, it 
threatens to undermine a decade’s growth and 
poverty reduction. for rich countries, it puts 
new pressures on household and government 
budgets – nowhere more so than in the UK, 
where Labour’s appalling mismanagement 
of the economy has saddled us with 
unprecedented levels of debt. but we should 
use this opportunity to reaffi rm, not abandon, 
our values – which is why we will continue to 
increase the level of british aid. We will do so 
because it is in our national interest, as well 
as being the right thing to do. </p>

<h3 id="deliver_on_our_commitment_to_the_worlds_poorest_nations">Deliver on our commitment to the world’s poorest nations</h3>

<p>a new Conservative government will be fully 
committed to achieving, by 2013, the Un target 
of spending 0.7 per cent of national income 
as aid. We will stick to the rules laid down by 
the oeCD about what spending counts as aid. 
We will legislate in the fi rst session of a new 
Parliament to lock in this level of spending for 
every year from 2013. </p>

<p>We support the millennium Development 
goals and will continue to work towards them. 
We will maintain an independent Department 
for International Development (DFID) and keep 
aid untied from commercial interests. 
We will be completely transparent about the 
cost and performance of DfiD programmes by 
independently evaluating programmes and by 
introducing, where appropriate, payment 
by results. </p>

<p>Our bargain with taxpayers is this: in return 
for contributing your hard-earned money to 
helping the world’s poorest people, it is our 
duty to spend every penny of aid effectively. 
We will ensure british aid money is properly 
spent by publishing full details of british aid 
on the DfiD website. this will include 
spending data on a project-by-project basis, 
published in an open and standardised format 
so that it can be used by third party websites. 
in addition, we will work to bring about 
improved transparency of aid spending by 
other development organisations.</p>

<p>We will create a new myaid fund to allow 
british people a direct say on aid spending, as 
well as giving people in developing countries 
more say over how aid is spent in their 
communities. </p>

<p>Under Labour, our aid funding is not used 
in a focused way, and is sometimes spent in 
countries that should be looking after their 
own poor citizens. So we will stop giving aid 
to China and russia and review which other 
countries should get british aid. We will focus 
more on the poorest, paying particular attention 
to development within the Commonwealth. </p>

<p>a key aim of our aid is to make sure everyone 
gets access to the basics: clean water, 
sanitation, healthcare and education. We will 
focus particularly on the rights of women, 
children and disabled people to access these 
services. malaria continues to kill nearly a 
million people per year, despite the fact that it 
is easily preventable and treatable. So, as part 
of our commitment to increase aid funding, a 
Conservative government will spend at least 
£500 million per year tackling malaria and will 
strongly support efforts to develop a malaria 
vaccine. </p>

<p>trade and economic growth are the only 
sustainable way for developing countries to 
escape poverty, which is why we will put 
maximum effort into achieving an ambitious, 
pro-development global trade deal. our aid 
programme will help poor countries put in 
place the building blocks of wealth creation: 
property rights, effective public services, 
stability and the rule of law. </p>

<p>We will provide a more integrated approach 
to post-conflict reconstruction where the 
british military is involved – building on the 
Stabilisation Unit in Whitehall and creating 
a new Stabilisation and reconstruction force 
to bridge the gap between the military and the 
reconstruction effort. </p>

<p>to help deliver on our commitment to 
developing countries, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li>establish a Poverty impact fund to support innovative and effective british poverty- 
fighting groups which do not currently 
qualify for government funding; </li>
<li>explore ways to help the very poorest developing countries take part in 
international climate change negotiations, 
and work to make our aid ‘climate-smart’; </li>
<li>end Labour’s use of the Export Credit guarantee Department to support investment 
in dirty fossil fuel power stations, and instead 
use it to help spread new green energy 
technology to developing countries; and, </li>
<li>encourage the establishment of a Pan-african free trade area, which has the potential to 
transform that continent’s economies.</li>
</ul>
